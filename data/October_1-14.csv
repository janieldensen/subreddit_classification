nfl,,[NY Post] Antonio Brown exposes himself to stunned guests in pool
nfl,"Currently, all NFL teams employ their own medical staff at their discretion. Most teams even have a medical sponsorship with a local hospital. 

I know there's multiple codes of ethics doctors are supposed to follow, but your boss being a billionaire and handing you a blank check to say their star QB did not suffer a concussion doesn't sound farfetched.

Why can't we have NFLPA approved or NFL appointed medical staffing? What if a team provides their own referees for home games?","Why are ""team doctors"" owned by the team?"

nfl,,[New York Post] Mr. Bare Cheeks exposes himself in hotel pool and sexually assaults woman on camera
nfl,"How about mandatory concussion checks for most or all players after every game or after most games? (Criteria established by variables that would be too many to consider here.) It would signal the league's acceptance that head injuries are a basic workplace hazard for its employees.

It's understood by now that concussions can result from relatively non-spectacular impacts. And it's a given that players and teams minimize or conceal these injuries. Why not  accept these realities and build basic protective protocol to respond to it? It's a protection players deserve and which NFL owners could certainly afford and accommodate.

An analogy: people who work in environments w frequent radiation contact have tools / procedures to constantly monitor levels. Why? Bc it's reasonable to conclude (let's put it) that radiation exposure can pose lasting and life-threatening consequences.

Makes financial sense from the NFL's perspective to enhance concussion monitoring (after all, concussions can't really be prevented), particularly in the context of the *hundreds of million$* the league has paid for concussion lawsuits in recent years. It's reasonable to suggest that such lawsuits will continue / increase in the future. And it's safe to question whether the NFL has done anything significant to reduce its exposure to such lawsuits. 

Maybe more complete, granular monitoring could improve 'workplace safety' and reduce the league's legal / financial liability going forward.",Regular monitoring

Week 1: Played the giants on fox. This was an interconfrence game so there was nothing really to see here

Week 2: Played in primetime

Week 3: played the raiders on fox. An afc game on fox is weird, but it happens every once in a while.

nfl,"[A link to the OTL report.](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/9125446/rethink-giving-athlete-charities) The short and sweet is that these foundations are rife with grift, and commonly are used to pay relatives of the athlete high salaries for doing virtually zero work. At best they tend to promote only self-serving causes. At worst your donations throw them a big birthday bash every year under the guise of charity.




Some real-life stories from the NFL:

D'Brickashaw Ferguson's charity set out to give scholarships to underprivledged children. [But it paid his mother four times more than it ever distributed in scholarships.](https://nypost.com/2012/07/01/nyc-star-athletes-like-sabathia-ferguson-run-lousy-charities/)

Deadspin used to [run a series written by an anonymous PR guy](https://deadspin.com/why-i-lie-an-athletes-pr-guy-comes-clean-5918438) who managed a professional football player's public image. One of his first capitulations was that the athlete's charity did nothing more than pay his family members at a reduced tax rate.


The Favre 4 Hope foundation seeks to help the disabled, and cancer patients, [but gave its most generous donations to his alma mater The University of Southern Mississippi and his daughter's high school volleyball team](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/34686830/hall-fame-qb-brett-favre-charity-donated-university-southern-mississippi-athletic-foundation-pushed-state-funds). This is separate from his current welfare fraud accusations.


Falling short of a scam, but still in a similar gray area, Tom Brady had a previously undisclosed passthrough arrangement with his charity. He would shill for Best Friends International which sought to help the mentally handicapped get employment.[ BFI would then send a percentage of their donations to his Change The World Foundation](https://www3.bostonglobe.com/sports/2017/04/22/tom-brady-gives-much-best-buddies-but-takes-millions-for-his-personal-trust/fX6A4ZqPaYAehmHllm9iLI/story.html?arc404=true) - which mostly boosted his personal interests like his kids private school and the University of Michigan. So basically people who gave money to support the mentally handicapped were unknowingly boosting the Wolverines football team.



If you want to donate to a good cause then [use Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/). You can even put it in an athlete's name if you want to. But please stop giving to the athlete's foundations.","I love the sportsmanship in donating to injured player's charities but statistically speaking very little of that will ever reach people who need it.

At first glance, the ARob signing looks to have been a swing and a miss. He's only played 3 games compared to 4 for everyone else, but on the eye test, he looks as slow as he did last year and doesn't seem to have the trust of Stafford. The moves made to acquire Hollywood Brown and Christian Kirk were mocked by a lot of people during the offseason, but so far, these two WRs have been producing at a rate much higher than what people expected.

Here is my humble proposal to enhance the NFL schedule:

Cut down to 2 preseason games
Increase to 18 regular season games
Regular season is 20 weeks
Bye Week for all teams Week 7 and Week 14
Trade deadline Wednesday of Week 14
Expand to 8 international games, to be held in Week 5 or Week 13

Benefits- better player health and safety, extra regular season game
Cons - two league wide dead weeks, an increase in international games may not be a good thing

1': Early shot from distance by Leicester, Dewsbury-Hall doesn't come anywhere close to the target.

12': Dewsbury-Hall tries again from distance and puts it wide.

14': Free kick reaches Vardy who heads it wide.

15': An incisive pass springs Vardy, he fires from a tight angle and is saved by Henderson.

18': [](#icon-yellow) *Neco Williams* carded for handball

22': FOREST HITS THE POST!! How did they not score there? Awoniyi got past the backline and put his shot past Ward but couldn't beat the woodwork!

25': [](#icon-ball-big) **GOAL LEICESTER!! *James Madisson* picks up a deflected pass, he fires and it ricochets off McKenna's arm past Henderson!**

27': [](#icon-ball-big) **GOAL LEICESTER!! *Harvey Barnes* fires a screamer! They've put up a two-goal lead in just a minte or so of play!**

soccer,,"[Football Daily] Graham Potter on Rafael Leao: ""I've been really impressed by him whenever I watch his games. He's making a difference for Milan, he contributes to how they attack, how they score. Congratulations to him for that, he's a top player. In terms of what happens in the future, who knows"""
soccer,[removed],What made Neymar laugh? Mbappe and Messi messing about in PSG training?üòÇ
soccer,"Rafael¬†Leao admits he felt ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt handle the pressure‚Äô at¬†Milan¬†in his early years, but thanked the club for helping him through it and now feels that he is ‚Äòa resource‚Äô for them against Chelsea.

The Rossoneri are in London for the Champions League clash with Chelsea on Wednesday evening, so naturally that has stirred up the speculation from the summer that the Stamford Bridge side wanted to purchase Leao.


Meanwhile, he has spoken to the official UEFA Champions League show about his life and career building up to the Scudetto victory.

‚ÄúI was destined to play football, I lived in a poor neighbourhood and it was not easy. If we believe in ourselves, we can go far.‚Äù

He left Sporting CP in controversial circumstances, terminating his contract unilaterally when the training ground was invaded by angry fans, for which he is still forced to pay the club a ‚Ç¨20m reimbursement fee.

‚ÄúI left Sporting at the age of 19 and stayed at Lille for just one season. When Milan called, I felt such joy. I was so happy, but also anxious, because from one moment to the next one of the biggest clubs in Europe wanted me.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt say no. But it‚Äôs not easy to join a club like that at the age of 19. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure, I couldn‚Äôt respond positively on the pitch.‚Äù

Leao did indeed struggle initially at San Siro, as while the potential was evident, he tended to make rash decisions and waste clear-cut scoring chances.

His position on the pitch also moved around, sometimes as a centre-forward, before finding his true niche on the left wing under the patient guidance of coach Stefano Pioli.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt lose this opportunity to prove what I could do and the club had no intention of selling me either. They believed in me.""

‚ÄúThat show of faith helped me to grow and improve. Now I feel that I am a precious resource for the team and the club, so I can really help my teammates in matches.‚Äù

[Source](https://www.football-italia.net/rafael-leao-couldnt-handle-pressure-but-milan-believed-in-me/)","Rafael Leao: ""It‚Äôs not easy to join a club like Milan at the age of 19.

soccer,"Since February I‚Äôve been making playlists where I add highlights from the best sports games from every day. I‚Äôve been slowly adding sports as I progress but making my selection more selective at the same time. Currently I‚Äôm doing Soccer, MLB, NFL, Formula 1 and I will return to the NHL when the season restarts next week. I believe the playlist will only show every video in the USA. My selection processes have changed slightly but they are roughly the same as the are now. They are as below:

Men‚Äôs Soccer: I use 538s SPI rankings. Not the best but very easy to use. I add every game played by every team in the top 10 in the world at the time the game is played (Exception: I don‚Äôt put in Ajax‚Äôs domestic games) Also I add every game played by teams in the EPL with a SPI 75 or greater (currently big 6 plus Brighton). Also regardless of who is in them I will include every champions league quarter final or later, Europa league semi final or later, and conference league final. International games I don‚Äôt have strict criteria but I try to include interesting games and will add every World Cup game. 

Women‚Äôs Soccer: Basically just the NWSL and the WSL. Again I pick and choose manually but the general rule is games between 2 good teams. Internationally same as the Men. 

MLB: Obviously as there is way to many games and it‚Äôs impossible to guess which ones will be good so this is the only sport I do after the games are over. I use average leverage index as calculated by Fangraphs to find which games have the most high leverage moments. An aLi of 1.5 is required. I also include games with at least 20 runs too because those are always fun. Also I will include all playoff games. 

NFL and NHL: 538 has a great tool for this. It gives each game a score of 0-100 for how good the teams are and another score of 0-100 on its impact on playoff odds. Then another one that just averages those two numbers. I‚Äôve been adding any game that has an average of at least 75 for the NFL and 60 for the NHL. Every NFL game obviously matters more as there are less of them. I also include all playoff games. 

Formula 1: All qualifying and race highlights

After that, Russ had his first losing season in his entire career, ending his own record for most seasons with a winning record to start a career. Though he finished with a strong win against the playoff bound Cardinals, it was clear that he wasn‚Äôt the same player that he had been in years past. This trend has continued as he switched teams and became a Bronco, and while he hasn‚Äôt exactly played poorly, he‚Äôs certainly not the one man army that we knew him to be.

On a personal note, I‚Äôve always loved Russ, as he was the first player that I didn‚Äôt need a more well-educated family member to tell me he was good. I had liked him since his rookie year, and always thought he could be capable.

My question is: what has caused this decline in play? Have defenses adjusted to his style of play while he has failed to keep up? Has he regressed in his decision making? Is his body starting to fail him as he gets older?

&amp;#x200B;

Similar to what I did last week, with the [top five college players at each position](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2022/09/30/top-five-players-at-each-position-in-college-football-right-now/) a month into the season, I wanted to take a look at the landscape of the NFL, only from a team perspective, ranking them from number one all the way to 32. Due to the addition of a 17th game last year, the quarter-pole isn‚Äôt quite exact, but I think this a great time to give a resum√© on what we‚Äôve seen so far.

These are not ‚Äúpower ratings‚Äù, but rather rankings based on my film study, putting performances into context and using (advanced) statistics to support my case. Therefore you will see teams with worse records or even those who have lost to others in their direct matchups, be higher up than those other squads.

This is what I came up with:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

### 1. Philadelphia Eagles (4-0)

It‚Äôs not like I really had another choice than putting the lone undefeated team at the top of the rankings, but in kind of a three-team race at the top, the Eagles are probably the most complete and healthiest among them. They don‚Äôt have a superhuman at quarterback like the other two, but Jalen Hurts is playing at as high a level as he‚Äôs ever done, ripping the ball over the middle of the field to A.J. Brown with confidence and lofting it down the field to DeVonta Smith, as long as putting the touch on the ball for Dallas Goedert on crossing routes and then killing teams with his legs when the first two reads aren‚Äôt there. You combine that with the fifth-ranked rushing attack (165.3 yards per game) and a defense that has already shown an ability to change things up a little bit from what coordinator Johnathan Gannon put on display last year and in week one. They are currently number three in yards allowed per play (4.5) and DVOA (-24.8), tied for first in takeaways (10) and alone at the top in sacks (16) and pressure rate (33.3%). Plus, their turnover differential of +8 is also three better than the next-closest group.

&amp;#x200B;

### 2. Buffalo Bills (3-1)

The order of number two and three wasn‚Äôt easy to decide, but I ultimately settled on my pick for the Super Bowl winner before the season started. My initial hold-up was Buffalo‚Äôs health status, particularly on the offensive line and the secondary, but the front-five was back at full health at Baltimore and while the loss of Micah Hyde is big, they‚Äôve been able to put that inexperienced back-end defensively in position to succeed. When you look at their schedule, they blew out the reigning Super Bowl champs and top-seeded AFC team from last year by a combined score of 72-17, more than doubled the Dolphins offensive yardage and simply needed two more seconds to kick a game-winning field goal, and just found a way to come back from 17 down at a tough place to win in Baltimore. The Bills lead the league with 99 first downs gained and a third-down conversion percentage of 55.8% offensively, where Josh Allen is an absolute cheat-code, because he can carve you up within the structure of plays, but then also create something out of nothing and run over a linebacker if needed, as he‚Äôs gained 146 yards on 17 scrambles alone. And while the defense has been banged up, especially in the secondary, they‚Äôre still currently behind only the 49ers in yards per play (4.2) and DVOA (-28.0%), with Von Miller looking like a DPOY candidate again and one of the best units at rallying to the football.

### 3. Kansas City Chiefs (3-1)

At the most fundamental core of the modern NFL, these are the three biggest questions you ask about a team: Who is your quarterback? Can you protect him? And can get after the guy for your opponents? Well, Patrick Mahomes showed once again on Sunday night that he can play at as high level as anybody has ever done in football, when he put 41 points on what was the top-ranked Bucs defense in DVOA, and he‚Äôs back to number one in EPA per play for the position. He has only been sacked on 3.3 percent of his dropbacks (third-lowest in the league) and the offense overall is averaging a league-best 2.93 points per drive. And KC‚Äôs defense has pressured the quarterback at a top-five rate in the league (28.9%), along with holding opponents to the fewest rushing yards per game (65.8) defensively. The loss of Tyreek Hill has made them a little less of a vertical passing attack, but they‚Äôve attacked the middle of the field and spread the ball around more, with a league-high eight different players having scored touchdowns already. And they should really be 4-0 right now, if not for a couple of messed up field goal tries or a personal foul on Chris Jones extending a drive at Indianapolis.

&amp;#x200B;

### 4. Green Bay Packers (3-1)

There is certainly a drop-off after the top three, even though the Packers are equally 3-1. Having collected all these statistics, there just wasn‚Äôt really anything that really stood out about this team. They are tenth in offensive yards per play and tied for 17th on defense in that regard. The defense is top-seven in total yards and points respectively, but outside of holding the Bucs to just 34 rushing yards ‚Äì which has actually been one of the least-efficient offenses overall in the NFL ‚Äì they‚Äôve allowed their other three opponents to average 157.7 yards on the ground. And DC Joe Barry has shown a lack of willingness to adapt from his scheme, to take full advantage of his personnel, I believe. This is certainly a different style of offense that we‚Äôve seen in the past with Aaron Rodgers at the helm, as they‚Äôve use a lot of pony personnel (two true halfbacks) and leaned even more heavily into the RPO and quick game. Aaron Jones is averaging a league-best 6.8 yards per carry and Rodgers has managed games exceptionally well, but you have to question how well this style can hold up in more high-scoring affairs or negative game-scripts, as you rely on 11-year veteran Randall Cobb to convert third downs.

&amp;#x200B;

### 5. Baltimore Ravens (2-2)

I‚Äôm fully aware that Baltimore is ten spots higher than a 3-1 team and that they actually lost at home to the group I have right below them. Not having the direct tie-breaker over the Bills and Dolphins could hurt them down the road for playoff seeding, but it doesn‚Äôt make me question the quality of the team, since they should have probably won both those contests. Lamar Jackson wasn‚Äôt great in the second half versus Buffalo this past Sunday, but he‚Äôs been tremendous throwing the ball from the pocket, along with what he can add as a runner, pushing the offense to the fourth-highest yards per play (6.2) and number one in DVOA (23.1%). They could get an All-Pro level left tackle in Ronnie Stanley back any day now and J.K. Dobbins has already shown some juice in his return. The three major areas that worry me about Baltimore‚Äôs defense ‚Äì they can‚Äôt create consistent pressure without blitzing (15.3% pressure rate overall), they‚Äôve been a bad tackling team (28 missed being second-most to only the Texans) and we‚Äôve seen their young guys have some bad mental errors. However, they‚Äôre at least tied with the Eagles for a league-high ten takeaways. They‚Äôre also number one in yards per punt and kick return respectively, with what Devin Duvernay presents, and they‚Äôre tied with the Falcons for the second-fewest penalty yards responsible for (114).

&amp;#x200B;

### 6. Miami Dolphins (3-1)

I have no problem with people wanting to put Miami a couple of spots higher, because when Tua Tagovailoa suffered that scary concussion against the Bengals, they were only down by one point and might still be undefeated if he stays healthy for the game. First-year head coach Mike McDaniel has designed an offense that puts their two main play-makers ‚Äì Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle ‚Äì in position to create huge plays and made Tua look like an MVP candidate, as he‚Äôs currently behind only Patrick Mahomes in EPA per play, while ranking behind only the Lions in yards per play (6.4) and the Ravens in DVOA (20.6%) as a unit. Defensively, we‚Äôve seen Lamar Jackson carve up their man-blitzes with hot routes and guys being able to create some separation off the line. However, when they faced Josh Allen, they ran a ton of cover-two and got to it in a myriad of different ways. Right now, they actually only blitz quarterbacks at the eighth-highest rate (24.4%) compared to finishing second the two prior seasons, but they also only create pressure at the second-lowest rate (13.4%), as they‚Äôre focused on having largely space-eaters in the middle to stop the run. Two things that concern me about their offense ‚Äì other than Tua‚Äôs health, which is a completely different discussion ‚Äì their QB is pressured on 26.4% of dropbacks (fourth-highest rate) and they have yet to rush for more than 86 yards in a game.

&amp;#x200B;

### 7. San Francisco 49ers (2-2)

Week one was definitely a shocker, seeing the Bears win 19-10 in that rainstorm, and then second-year quarterback Trey Lance was lost for the year with a badly fractured ankle early on the next game. They still beat up on the Seahawks that day and then were Jimmy Garoppolo stepping on the end-line for a safety in Denver away from being 3-1 right now. Don‚Äôt get fooled by the final score this past Monday night ‚Äì the Niners dominated that matchup against the Rams, as they‚Äôve done in the Shanahan-vs.-McVay era. San Francisco‚Äôs defense has been phenomenal so far, allowing the fewest points per game (11.5) and yards per play league-wide (3.8), while pressuring quarterbacks at the second-highest rate in correlation to their blitz rate (27.6% pressure on 9.2% of blitzes). I was worried about the offense early, because those limitations from the QB position remain, which is why I had to smirk a little bit when I saw Jimmy just force those deep shots outside the numbers all of a sudden when he got inserted. But what I saw against the Rams, with all the creativity in the run game, mixing in wind-back blocks and counter-like cutback action in the backfield, plus all the YAC opportunities Kyle creates off that (55.1% of receiving yards coming after the catch), I think they have the formula to be a major player in an NFC, which currently seems like a one-team show.

&amp;#x200B;

### 8. Minnesota Vikings (3-1)

The Vikings are one of the teams, where I‚Äôm not totally sure what to make of their offensive structure. Week one they come out and make the Packers secondary point fingers and roll their eyes, because of the way they force them to pass off routes and receivers are catching the ball with nobody else in the vicinity, but then Kirk Cousins looks like he‚Äôs never seen a zero-blitz and throws the ball into no-man‚Äôs land the week after at Philly, where they only score seven points. Justin Jefferson has been basically uncoverable, unless he‚Äôs facing true brackets, but they‚Äôve been inconsistent running the ball, with zero carries of 20+ yards, and converting third downs and red-zone opportunities as a unit, where they‚Äôre 28th and 26th league-wide respectively. Minnesota‚Äôs defense is clearly built to slow down aerial attacks and relied on those big bodies they added up front to control the line. They‚Äôve forced at least one turnover in all four games so far, but it simply feels too easy for opponents to move the ball on them(bottom-eight in plays and yards per drive, first downs, yards per play). Still, they are the only team in the league with less than 100 penalty yards (95) and they‚Äôre number one in the Halil‚Äôs Real Footballtalk statistic, with an average +6.9 yards of field position, comparing starting points of drives between them and their opponents.

&amp;#x200B;

### 9. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-2)

When Tom Brady announced his un-retirement this summer, I don‚Äôt think anybody expected the Bucs to need a couple of garbage time touchdowns in the fourth quarter (plus a few seconds) of week four against the Chiefs, to finally score more than 20 points in a game. Considering Leonard Fournette gashed the Cowboys for 127 yards in the season-opener, it‚Äôs pretty shocking that they‚Äôve gained the second-fewest yards on the ground as a team, as they‚Äôve barely matched that total over the past three weeks combined (258 altogether now). The issues through the air are more understandable, considering how banged up their receiving corp has been basically from the jump. Still, up until SNF, when they were quickly down by three scores and needed to catch up, only the Colts had averaged less points per drive offensively (1.25) so far, despite Brady being the least-pressured QB once again (10.5% of dropbacks). On the flipside, their defense was number one in the league, both in points allowed per possession (0.75) and DVOA, before Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs got their revenge from their Super Bowl two years ago, shredding them for 41 points just now on Sunday night. After that, they‚Äôve slid down a few spots, but in terms of the ability to make offenses one-dimensional, the way they can pressure the passer with six legit rushers on any play and the tight coverage they can play on the back-end, they‚Äôll remain as one of the toughest units.

&amp;#x200B;

### 10. Jacksonville Jaguars (2-2)

I know the Jaguars lost week one to Washington and just had a 43-minute scoring drought after starting off 14-0 at Philadelphia and ultimately losing by eight, but I believe they are clearly the best team in the AFC South. Let‚Äôs play a little game ‚Äì Can you list the teams with a better scoring margin than the Jags? If you go by my rankings, you can stop after the top two in the Bills and Eagles, as they sit at +9.5 PPG. Their youth certainly showed in their season-opener against Washington, but they‚Äôve shown major growth already and went on to blow out the Colts and Chargers by a combined score of 62-10, before putting up a valiant fight at Philly. Their offensive play-designs under Press Taylor have been highly impressive and creative, as they had scored at the highest and turned the ball over at the lowest rates in the NFL respectively, prior to playing in that Philadelphia rainstorm. I love the combination of pieces defensively and how Mike Caldwell has brought it all together, throwing a bunch of different pressure looks at opponents and disguising the coverages behind it, which it‚Äôs how they‚Äôve allowed opponents to score at the third-lowest (24.4%) and turned over at the third-highest rates (20.0%) respectively. And having Doug Pederson has just taken them to a completely different level of competency.

&amp;#x200B;

### 11. Los Angeles Chargers (2-2)

Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì if this team can survive some of the early injuries and get to the tournament at (close to) full strength, I believe they have the capability to take out pretty much anybody, but it‚Äôs just not a disclaimer I wanted to give this soon and they haven‚Äôt been the team I thought they could be. The Chargers lead the league with 307.3 net passing yards per game, while Justin Herbert has been sacked less than any other full-time starter (four). However, they are dead-last with just 64.5 yards rushing per game and 2.7 yards per attempt. And while the rate of Herbert being allowed to attack down the field conceptually is starting to climb, too much of what Joe Lombardi has designed for him feels static and their receivers aren‚Äôt really allowed to catch the ball on the run. On the flipside, as much as I lauded this improved defense ‚Äì and Khalil Mack has looked a lot more like the Defensive Player of the Year version than what we had seen in Chicago over the past couple of years ‚Äì particularly talking about how all those big bodies they can rotate through on the D-line may improve their run defense, still only the Lions have given up more yards per carry than them (5.4). I do like Brandon Staley‚Äôs willingness to change things up schematically for specific matchups though.

&amp;#x200B;

### 12. Los Angeles Rams (2-2)

I almost want to move the Rams down a couple of spots further, because they‚Äôve been so disappointing against the two actual contenders they‚Äôve faced, losing by a combined score of 55-19 to the Bills and 49ers. They still have some true star players and Sean McVay‚Äôs track record makes you feel good about their ability to get this thing back on the right track, yet I‚Äôm just not excited about what the reigning champs currently are. So far, their offense has just been a mess. Everything but Stafford hitting Kupp over the middle seems so hard for the Rams right now ‚Äì there are no easy plays it feels like. I‚Äôm starting to feel like Matt is back in Detroit, as only Carson Wentz has been sacked more often this year (16) and they‚Äôre rushing for an NFL-low 54.3 yards per game, which then makes him try to force the issue and lead the league in interceptions (six). Plus, after they gushed about Allen Robinson all offseason, he‚Äôs caught nine passes for 95 yards so far. Defensively, they‚Äôre pretty average across the board, other than being the only team to pressure opposing quarterbacks on less than 10% of dropbacks. That‚Äôs where I have belief in Raheem Morris continuing to mold his scheme around strengths of their players though, as they need somebody not named Aaron Donald to start creating more negative plays.

&amp;#x200B;

### 13. Dallas Cowboys (3-1)

This is just so not the team I ‚Äì or many others I‚Äôm sure ‚Äì envisioned the Cowboys to be. When Dak Prescott broke his thumb late in their season-opener against the Bucs, I felt really good about my bet involving them missing the playoffs, because I was concerned about what this re-shuffled offensive line and the defense as a unit would look like, with all the personnel losses they suffered this offense. Ever since that happened, I feel like this has gone from a team wanting to push up the score and then let their D-line rush the passer, to more of an old-school approach generally. Their offense has taken care of the ball, as they are tied with the Eagles and Cardinals for the fewest giveaways in the NFL at just two, and the defense has been able to continue their dominance from last year, but in a different, more sustainable way. They are third in points per game (15.5), fourth in yards per play (4.6), second in sacks (15) and pressure percentage (32.7%), second in tackles for loss (27) and top-eight in third-, fourth-down and red-zone TD percentage. The fact that they allow five yards per rush so far can be called a flaw, but that‚Äôs the way they ask you to win and we haven‚Äôt seen anybody but the Bucs do, back in week one.

&amp;#x200B;

### 14. Cincinnati Bengals (2-2)

I released an [in-depth video breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlX4udgVxv4&amp;t=659s) on the issues the Bengals had on offense when they were off to an 0-2 start, talking about how they structure their protections in a sub-optimal way, individual breakdowns along the front, Joe Burrow starting to let the rush affect his whole process and just their inefficient early-down tendencies, leading to rushing average of just 3.1 yards (tied for second-lowest in the league). Well, they have scored 27 points since against the Jets and Dolphins each ‚Äì as much as they had through their first two weeks combined ‚Äì and only turned it over once total. They‚Äôve now had three different 100-yard receivers and as long as they understand their limitations based on the O-line ‚Äì like not being able to create any push in goal-line situations ‚Äì and Burrow stays healthy, they should be fine. Their defense has really picked things up over the last two weeks as well, taking the ball away six times and holding teams to just 9-of-28 on third downs (32.1%). Trey Hendrickson in particular has been a menace, racking up 11 combined pressures and 2.5 sacks on less than 100 total snaps. I look at the Ravens as the clear favorite to win the AFC North, but now all of a sudden if the Bengals can win at Baltimore Sunday night, they all of a sudden take the lead in that division. 

&amp;#x200B;

### 15. New York Giants (3-1)

To be honest, it‚Äôs kind of refreshing to see a team win games with more of an old-school approach offensively, even if I don‚Äôt the Giants‚Äô record may not be fully representative of how good this team is. New York is averaging a league-low 4.6 net yards per pass attempt, with their four passes of 20+ yards so far being only half of the next-closest team, and they‚Äôre ahead of only the Bears ‚Äì who are in their own stratosphere ‚Äì in net passing yards altogether (558). This makes what Saquon Barkley and the ground game have done all the more impressive, as he individually (463) and the team as a whole (770) lead the league in rushing yards. It makes total sense for them to feature that kind of special talent heavily, particularly considering they can‚Äôt keep Daniel Jones on his feet, as he has been pressured at by far the highest rate in the league (35.8%). Defensively, Wink Martindale has done a great job of getting this unit to excel situationally, as they‚Äôre number two on third downs (29.4%) and red-zone touchdown percentage (35.7%), along with going after the ball and forcing a league-high six fumbles. Wink has stayed true to his philosophy, blitzing at a league-high 45.3% of snaps, but it‚Äôs been more fire-zones than flat-out man along with it. Most importantly, Brian Daboll‚Äôs staff has given this franchise some belief and direction again.

&amp;#x200B;

### 16. Atlanta Falcons (2-2)

Getting back to what I said about the Giants two paragraphs ago, it‚Äôs pretty cool to see a team go against what modern offenses typically look like and play winning football. Only the no-fly zone offense of the Bears has run the ball at a higher rate than the Falcons this season (55.5%). They just won a game against the Browns, where their quarterback completed seven(!) passes. When they do throw the ball, they want to attack down the field, particularly from more condensed formations and taking play-action shots, as Marcus Mariota is behind only Jameis Winston with 10.8 intended air yards per attempt. Arthur Smith deserves credit for the creativity he‚Äôs showcased and the diversity that unit challenges opponents with. Their one issue is, while being second in percentage of drives yielding points (47.5), they‚Äôve also turned the ball over at the eighth-highest rate (17.5%). I think their defense will end up breaking their back ultimately, as they‚Äôve pressured the opposing quarterback on the third-lowest rate of dropbacks (14.3%) and currently are 21st in both yards per pass and run. However, they‚Äôve forced seven turnovers and only missed seven tackles on the season so far, which is tied for the fewest along with Tampa Bay. And they‚Äôve been disciplined, being tied with the Ravens for the second-fewest penalty yards responsible for (114).

&amp;#x200B;

### 17. Cleveland Browns (2-2)

Continuing our trend of offense flowing through the run game, the Browns have been absolutely dominant on the ground once again this season. They‚Äôre currently second to only the Giants with 187.3 rushing yards per game, they‚Äôve picked up a league-high 46 first downs on the ground and eight 20+ yard carries, with Nick Chubb averaging 5.7 yards per attempt. And Jacoby Brissett has done a great job of managing games, whether it‚Äôs about standing tall inside the pocket and drilling throws over the middle or being automatic on QB sneaks in short-yardage situations. He‚Äôs currently top-ten in EPA per play among quarterbacks (0.152), while the offense is top-six in percentages of drives leading to points (46.3%) and turnovers (7.3%) ‚Äì which is actually way up with two of their three total giveaway coming this past Sunday ‚Äì as well as being comfortably number one in time of possessions, by nearly two minutes (35:38). There‚Äôs still a lot to like about Cleveland‚Äôs defense as well, looking at how all those top-50 picks in the secondary have looked like and their edge pass-rush, but they‚Äôre banged up along the front, with unproven commodities on the interior, and they‚Äôre 30th in DVOA on that side of the ball right now. I mean after Marcus Mariota threw an interception this past Sunday, they couldn‚Äôt do anything against a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive with all run plays.

&amp;#x200B;

### 18. Tennessee Titans (2-2)

It‚Äôs hard for me to get really excited about this Titans team now winning back-to-back games, when those have come against a couple of one-win teams and both of them nearly came back in those contests after slow starts. I mean really what it comes down to is that they‚Äôre 21st in yards per play on offense (5.2) and 30th on defense (6.3). We‚Äôve seen the Derrick Henry were typically used to these past two weeks (50 touches for 290 yards) and they lead the league with a red-zone touchdown rate of 90%. So if they can lean on that and then see rookie receiver Treylon Burks grow into a guy they can hit on those digs and crossers on the run off that, at least in the mold of what they had with A.J. Brown, that side of the ball can do enough, if the defense plays at the level they have done in the past ‚Äì unfortunately they don‚Äôt. Without Harold Landry, they haven‚Äôt been able to rush the passer nearly as effectively, with a pressure rate of 24.5% (14th in the NFL) and their corner group has been shockingly bad, allowing 7.2 net passing yards per attempt (tied for fourth-most). They allowed a run and pass play of over 60 yards to the Giants, the Bills laid 41 points on them, Raiders receiver Mack Hollins more than doubled his previous career-high in receiving yards (158) and even broken-down-looking Matt Ryan averaged 9.6 yards per pass this past Sunday. At least they have a weapon in rookie punter Ryan Stonehouse, who leads the league with an average 56.2 yards per boot.

&amp;#x200B;

### 19. Denver Broncos (2-2)

There‚Äôs no way around ‚Äì the Broncos offense has been incompetent considering the pieces they have (had) theoretically. The bulk of the blame has to go to Russell Wilson and Nathaniel Hackett, for putting together this monstrosity of a merge between a Shanahan/West Coast-style and the Russ offense, where they don‚Äôt ever seem to gain any easy yardage, because they spread the field only to take shots down the sideline anyway and the open looks they can create through horizontal spacing, Russ isn‚Äôt comfortable with. Under Hackett, they‚Äôve been the most-penalized team in the league (37 for 286) and their offense has converted easily the lowest rate of red-zone possessions into touchdowns (30% - three of ten). And now they lose their most promising player on that side of the ball, in second-year running back Javonte Williams. The defense looked good through three weeks, when they allowed just 36 combined points, and still is promising, but now they just let the Raiders score a season-high 32, nearly match their previous season total with 212 rushing yards and get their first W. At least on special teams, Montrell Washington has given Denver a true difference-maker in the return game, after they ranked 20th and 32nd in punt and kick return yardage respectively last season.

&amp;#x200B;

### 20. Arizona Cardinals (2-2)

Unlike popular belief would tell you ‚Äì this is not an explosive Cardinals offense, as only the Commanders have averaged less than their 4.8 yards per play and Kyler Murray actually is dead-last with just 6.0 intended air yards per pass attempt. However, they are tied with two NFC East teams ‚Äì the Eagles and Cowboys ‚Äì with a league-low two giveaways. And thanks to the defense going after the ball, they are third in the NFL overall with a turnover differential of +4. That Chiefs game week one certainly is a huge factor here, when Patrick Mahomes had a nearly perfect game dicing up Arizona‚Äôs blitz-heavy approach, but opponents had scored on a league-high 57.1% of drives against them, before facing the worst offense in the league in the Panthers ‚Äì now they‚Äôre down to number three. A big factor in that has been the lack of negative plays created, being tied with the Saints for a league-low 12 TFLs and alone at the bottom with just four sacks. We‚Äôre two weeks away from DeAndre Hopkins returning, which is huge for Kyler as his always-trusted alert on the backside, whenever he‚Äôs one-on-one basically, but James Conner is averaging a miniscule 3.2 yards per carry and there‚Äôs nothing Kliff Kingsbury does still from a design perspective that gives his quarterback any lay-ups.

&amp;#x200B;

### 21. New Orleans Saints (1-3)

Man, the numbers all say I should put the Saints even lower than this, but then without their starting quarterback, running back and number one(?) receiver, they a double-doink field goal miss away from going to overtime against a fully healthy Vikings team in London this past Sunday. New Orleans currently has the worst turnover differential in the NFL at -7, due a league-high 11 giveaways. That is certainly a huge factor in being the worst team in what I labelled the HRF-statistic last year, with a negative drive-start average compared to their opponents at -10.14, where they‚Äôre 32nd on both sides. Having seen Jameis Winston turn a 3-3 game with four minutes left into a 20-10 loss to the Bucs a couple of weeks ago, you understand that they are at risk of giving away games in that fashion. However, in the past they‚Äôve been able to bank on strong offensive line play, which they simply don‚Äôt have, being dead-average in rushing yards and pressure percentage on dropbacks. Defensively, only three other teams have actually pressured the opposing passer on a lower rate of dropbacks (14.8%). They‚Äôre still a top-ten run-stopping unit and have the players on the back-end to challenge offenses with press-man coverage or fitting the ball into cover-two holes, but without the rush to complement that, they won‚Äôt be able to reach those heights we‚Äôve seen in recent years.

&amp;#x200B;

### 22. New York Jets (2-2)

Talking about turnovers, only the Saints have given the ball more often this season than the Jets (nine). Having led in games a grand total of seven minutes so far on the year is definitely a huge factor in this, as they‚Äôre clearly number on in pass-play percentage at 70.2% ‚Äì the next-closest team is the Bucs at 66.1%. While they came just two yards short of it on Sunday and finally got into the end-zone that way, they have yet to hit the century-mark in rushing in any of their matchups so far, for a Mike LaFleur-coordinated offense. They‚Äôll need to support second-year QB Zach Wilson more in that regard, who looked good working against static zone looks, but is still gaining confidence in his talented group of young receivers to win in man. On the other side of the ball, despite losing their best run-defender in nose-tackle Folorunso Fatukasi, suprisingly they‚Äôre currently number six in yards allowed per carry (3.7). Yet, they‚Äôre still second-to-last on third down percentage allowed (51.0%) and 25th in defensive DVOA (9.3%). Robert Saleh may need to change up their looks a little bit, as they‚Äôve used a ton of four-man rushes and zone coverage behind it. They have two rangy linebackers to mug up and bring some fire-zone blitzes, so I‚Äôd like to see them take advantage of that.

&amp;#x200B;

### 23. Detroit Lions (1-3)

Detroit‚Äôs offense averages a league-best 6.5 yards per play and 5.9 yards per rush in particular, which is very impressive considering the two closest teams ‚Äì the Giants and Ravens ‚Äì have legit running threats at quarterback, unlike Jared Goff. To the quarterback‚Äôs credit however, he also leads the league with 18 completions of 20+ yards so far. They‚Äôve kept the him clean, allowing sacks at the second-lowest rate per dropback (3.2%), and they‚Äôre behind only the Titans with an 88.2% rate of red-zone trips being converted into touchdowns (15-of-17). So that‚Äôs all great. Why are the 1-3 and down here in my rankings? Well, their defense couldn‚Äôt stop a runny nose right. They have allowed 26 more points than any other team in the NFL, as they are currently on pace to shatter the record for most points surrendered in a season by 66. Opponents are gaining a league-high 5.6 yards per rush against them, while also being dead-last in third-down (52.8%) and red-zone conversion percentage (86.7%). They need to make some adjustments with playing less man-coverage, Aidan Hutchinson has to consistently create pressure like with those three sacks week two and they need to have a better plan for scrambling quarterbacks in key situations. The reason I didn‚Äôt drop them down even further is that they‚Äôve been banged up so far and I have a tough time imagining them continuing to play at that record-setting-ly bad pace defensively.

&amp;#x200B;

### 24. Las Vegas Raiders (1-3)

I didn‚Äôt expect Detroit and New Orleans to be 1-3 at this point either, but at least for those teams injuries have played a major role and they‚Äôve faced some tough opponents. The three Raider losses have come by four, six and two points respectively, but we‚Äôve already seen them both start slow and finish badly, without a whole lot of great in-between that. They‚Äôre actually the only team other than the Chiefs to score on exactly half of their offensive possessions, but thanks to the fourth-lowest TD conversion rate in the red-zone (44.4%) and their defense not getting the ball back, they‚Äôre somehow only tenth in points per game (24.0). Other than Maxx Crosby making multiple splash plays every week, there‚Äôs just nothing to get excited about with that unit. Their run-defense has been surprisingly stout, considering all the new faces on the interior D-line (only 3.9 yards per carry), but opposing QBs average 7.3 net yards per pass (third-highest) and have a cumulative passer rating of 103.2 against them. One way to put more pressure on their opponents ‚Äì I‚Äôd like them to be more aggressive with going for it themselves on fourth down, because if you don‚Äôt count the Steelers making their lone attempt this season, the Raiders are number one in conversion percentage (80% - four of five).

&amp;#x200B;

### 25. Seattle Seahawks (2-2)

For a lot of objective Seahawks fans, I think they would have been happy with beating Russell Wilson in his return and being 2-2 a month into the season. Their 48-point explosion against the Lions certainly made up for a big portion of it, but only Detroit and Miami have averaged more than their 6.3 yards per play and they‚Äôre also tied for second with the Dolphins in offensive DVOA (20.6%). Here are the quarterbacks that have put up a higher EPA per pass this season than Geno Smith ‚Äì Patrick Mahomes, Tua Tagovailoa and Josh Allen. They‚Äôre behind only the Bills in third-down percentage offensively (55.1%), but unfortunately only the Broncos ‚Äì who they defeated in week one ‚Äì have converted a lower rate of red-zone possessions into six points (41.7%). The defense has actually been the issue, as they‚Äôve given up 0.8 yards more per pass than any other team in the league (8.2), as well as being tied for the third-most yards per rush (5.1). They can‚Äôt really stop anything, as teams are running more plays, gaining more yards and points per drive against them than anybody else. They‚Äôre the only defense opponents average more than a field goal against (3.03 points) every time they take the field. And that‚Äôs with the Broncos only scoring six points combined on four red-zone possessions on opening Monday night.

&amp;#x200B;

### 26. New England Patriots (1-3)

I‚Äôm still pretty shocked how the Patriots were able to take the Packers to overtime this past Sunday at Lambeau Field and it feels bad to how them this low, but the numbers bear that out. Mac Jones has been one of the better deep-ball throwers since entering the league, so once he returns, they‚Äôll inevitably move back up the list. However, I don‚Äôt see Brian Hoyer or Bailey Zappe provide those explosive plays through the air, and they haven‚Äôt gotten them on the ground, as one of five teams in the NFL without a rush of 20+ yards, despite averaging 21 more carries than the other four squads. Considering they turn the ball over at the second-highest percentage of drives (21.4%), that‚Äôs just not a recipe for success. New England‚Äôs defense has performed better than I expected for the most part, considering the overhaul of personnel we‚Äôve seen for them, but they‚Äôre bottom-five in yards per rush (5.1) and third-down percentage (46.3%). Bill Belichick and has his coaching staff have done a solid job I‚Äôd say considering what they have at their disposal, the margin of error to still win games is razor-thin. Their next five opponents before the bye have eight combined wins. This would be the time to rack up W‚Äôs before a much tougher second half to their schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

### 27. Pittsburgh Steelers (1-3)

It‚Äôs Kenny Pickett time! I know that he tossed three picks in that second half on Sunday against the Jets for his debut, but I also thought he made some inspiring plays. It can‚Äôt be much worse than Mitch Trubisky being 30th in EPA per play and the offense averaging just 4.8 yards per play (tied for second-fewest). With Najee Harris averaging just 3.5 yards yet again behind that line however, they need to take advantage of those talented receivers down the field, to make things feel less condensed. Pittsburgh‚Äôs defense has certainly felt the loss of T.J. Watt from the season-opener, but Alex Highsmith has stepped up in a major way in his absence (currently second in the league with 5.5 sacks) and Minkah Fitzpatrick might be your front-runner for Defensive Player of the Year right now. They haven‚Äôt really been able to get off the field on third downs, allowing opponents to convert 45.3% of those (26th in the league), which certainly is a big factor in them being 31st in time per drive on either side of the ball and time of possession overall. Let‚Äôs see if their offense can put some pressure on the opposition going forward, so they don‚Äôt have to count on takeaways as frequently.

nfl,"I think most NFL fans know that not every Heisman winner has success in the NFL. There's been plenty of stories about those who play and must straight up do not succeed at all. What was more surprising when I was looking this morning was how many Heisman winners were, for their talent, either not drafted in the first round or never drafted at all. This was the list I found and some reasons why they either were drafted much lower than a Heisman winner might expect or not drafted at all in a couple cases.

Gary Bevan - 1967 (Included as the first  since super bowl 1 was that year for modern Era nfl football post merger.)

Herschel Walker (due to going to USFL first)

Doug Flutie (same as Walker)

Jason White (never even signed, let alone drafted. Teams worried about his knees)

Eric Crouch

Troy Smith (stock dropped a lot after the disastrous BCS national championship game)

I am looking to start a YouTube channel similar to ding Productions. I have a decent plan set for the channel on how to start and such. 

Basically, I am looking for a partner to do this with me. The reason I'm looking for a partner is because youtube's algorithm loves constant and constant uploading. This is much eiser with 2 people. And just overall I'd like to share this experience with someone who likes football as much as I do. 

Here's a little about me and my background. I am located out of Wisconsin and run a video editing business. I also do some YouTube management stuff for youtubers so I know quite alot about YouTube and the algorithm. I also have a channel where I do gta tutorials and it's starting to have decent success after about 2 months. Personally I love football. I never miss a game, I usually I have all the games pulled up on separate tabs to watch all of them haha. 

Anyways, if someone is interested in football and want to take their interest and turn it into a little bit of a hobby trying to grow on youtube, message me and we can talk about it.

Projected wins are the actual wins for each team *plus* the expected wins over the next 13 games, according to the Pythagorean performance of their first 4.  Ties are worth 0.5 wins.

**What is Pythagorean Theory**

Pythagorean Winning Percentage is a concept that strives to determine the number of games that a team *should* have won - based on the correlation between their total number of points scored versus its number of points allowed (greater positive differentials correlate to a better team record).   
 Originally made famous by baseball analyst Bill James, the formula have been adopted to other sports as well.

Statistician Daryl Morey later extended this theorem to other sports including professional football. Teams that win a game or more over what the Pythagorean theorem would project tend to regress the following year; teams that lose a game or more under what the Pythagorean theorem would project tend to win more the following year.

Maths for Pythagorean Expected Wins:

*Py Wins =¬†((PF\^Exp)/(PF\^Exp+PA\^Exp))\*G*

*Exp =¬†1.5\*LOG((PF+PA)/G)* 

Where EXP is the exponent in the Pythagorean equation, PF is points scored by a team, and PA is points against a team. The exponent, developed by Aaron Schatz and Football Outsiders, adjusts for the offensive environment of each team and replaces the static exponent of 2.37 suggested by Daryl Morey when he adapted Pythagorean wins for the NFL.  More on Offensive Environment [here](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/dvoa-ratings/2011/week-13-dvoa-ratings).

nfl,"So I think most ppl can agree that this years football season has been pretty ugly. Just based on what I've seen, not going over any numbers There's alot of 2-2 teams this year, maybe 4 teams  in the whole league looking the best ,KC Ravens Bills Packers . But even those teams have had some bad loses and ok wins. I have a theory that, alot of ppl think Brady is done after this year. Mainly, He's old, still playing at a decent level at 45. He's always said he would play with the whole retire unretire thing, with him and his wife on separate terms.  If he is , nobody really knows only he does. Well, this is a guy who has been brutally doubted throughout his whole career. Don't get it twisted, MR 199 won't let you forget that there's a mean chip on his shoulder. He has always responded to the haters especially after the Trent dilfer comments almost 10 years ago. ""Face it the Patriots aren't good anymore"", he was really talking to Tom Brady, if anything. At least that's how I think Tom Brady took those comments. And the stupid argument is Tom Brady a system quarterback or not he had to go to Tampa and prove that. Now he's always got Antonio Brown throwing shots I him, along with Nick Wright. His own wife has tried to force him to retire. He has just been picked at in certain ways, where he's always at war with proven haters wrong. Let's not forget winning a Superbowl with a torn MCL, in Tampa. I just think it has been a very ugly NFL season .Nobody really is clear-cut favorites for the Super Bowl and I think the way how Tampa started the first four games this year , that they are in contention to be super bowl winners. But here's the thing, now Brady has a hurt finger and shoulder. That is more fuel for doubters to keep that chip alive. I have a theory that, in sports when teams has devastating storms (Katrina and storm in Texas, Boston red Sox winning it all the year of the Boston Bombing at the charity run) I believe after Tampa facing a horrendous storm, that they win somehow win it for the City if Tampa. Brady with his hurt shoulder and finger. And the fact that and Brady's career he almost wins it every other year or goes to a Super bowl every other year. The fact this might be his last season, the whole thing going on with his wife and  injuries piling up. I think Bucs and Brady go to another Super Bowl this year. And I would like to think they either play the Bills or the Chiefs. Again, there's no clear cut favorites, it could be against the Ravens for that matter. That defense has been pretty good up until the Kansas City game and I think they will clean it up just like the old line for Brady before the end of the season.However, I believe Brady will keep playing throughout the year. But here's the thing, what if Brady keeps playing and he develops a torn rotator  cuff?  I mean he is 45, you don't heal as quickly at that age. If there's one QB that can win it all, with all this shit going on, he woukd be the guy. I dare I say predict the Bucs go to the Super bowl Brady wins his 8th and does it with a torn rotator cuff. That is my ultimate theory and prediction. Now does he walk off into the sun set? Who will they play in the Superbowl? Personally I'd love to see a Chiefs Bucs rematch with all Mahomes weapons and perfect Oline. Just to shut up the little cry babies about how Mahomes didn't have an Online, blah blah blah. And on top of it, the Super Bowl is in Arizona, (again, I feel like it's in Arizona every 2 years), That's also a reason I think we'll see Brady in the Superbowl. Idk, I just think this year is when he really shuts ppl up and maybe walks away.",Brady torn Rotator cuff...

**Drafts**: 2011-2021

**By the Numbers:**

* Total AV above expected: 558
* Players Graded as Steals: 7
   * the league average is 3.5
* Players Graded as Busts: 1
   * the league average is 4
* Best Draft Class: 2016 (3rd best overall)
* Draft Classes in the Top 10 per year: 7
* Top Positions: RB, QB, WR

**Top 10 Picks**

[Top 10 Picks](https://preview.redd.it/zzyvvp34ags91.png?width=2806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a76c5d3f47b3c11799a6517b596b65258921cf)

**Fantastic in the First Round**

The Cowboys have been the best team at drafting in the first round. They are so dominant, that their average AV above expected (dAV) is 10 points higher than the next-best team. Of the 10 picks they‚Äôve had in the first round, they have an 80% hit rate. 

[Cowboys First-Round Picks](https://preview.redd.it/gq96c06dags91.png?width=2806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f6d571b0256d6e22a5d8bb83f743850234b022)

**Very Few Busts**

During these drafts, the Cowboys have only drafted one player that has been graded as a bust. Over the same period, the league average is 4 players graded as busts per team.

**Analysis Methodology** 

* **How is a player's value measured?**
   * A measure called approximate value (AV) is used to determine a player's value, it was created by Doug Driven from PFR - you can read more about it [here](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html).
* **What is the expected value (xAV) of a draft pick?**
   * The analysis calculates the expected value (xAV) of a player based on their position and where in the draft the player was taken - based on players taken in other draft years
* **How is the grade of a draft pick determined?**
   * Grades are determined by first calculating the actual AV of a player during their first eight years (years 1-4 have a weight of 1.0 and years 5-8 have a weight of 0.5). This is then compared to the expected AV of a player of the same position, drafted in the same area of the draft (ex. Top 5, bottom half of the 2nd round etc.)
* **How was the number of years and weights selected?**
   * 8 years was chosen since 87% of drafted players play less than 8 years, and the years after that see a dip in performance as players age¬†
   * The first four years have the largest weight since this is the length of most rookie contracts. For a team to be successful, they need to maximize the output of their players while they are on cheap rookie contracts. Otherwise, the team is paying close to the free agent market value for the player
   * Players who have played less than 8 years are extrapolated out based on their performance in the seasons they have played
* **It's more than just the player**
   * The grades represent the value a team got in return for a draft pick and does not take into account other players available or raw player skill. An example of poor value for a draft pick is a skilled player who was consistently injured and rarely played. Injuries, off-the-field issues, poor coaching and back luck in addition to a player's skill are all key factors in determining the grade of a pick.","Jerry Jones &amp; the Cowboys are the best drafters of the last 10 years, and I have the math to prove it"

nfl,"The common narrative going around about the Broncos and Russell Wilson is ""this is just like Peyton Manning's first five games with the Broncos!""

No it's not.

Yes, the 2012 Broncos and the 2022 Broncos are both 2-3. That is apples-to-oranges. Here's why:

The 2012 Broncos were indeed 2-3. Their three losses were against the Falcons (made the NFC Championship that year), the Texans (made the divisional round that year), and the Pats (made the AFC championship that year). So they lost to really good teams.

Meanwhile, their two wins were against bad teams, but they DOMINATED them, chalking up easy wins against the Steelers (31-19) and the Raiders (a 37-6 drubbing). So they lost three games to great teams and destroyed terrible teams. The 2022 Broncos can't say that.

The 2022 Broncos are 2-3, with their three losses coming against the rebuilding Seahawks, the 1-3 Raiders and the 2-2-1 Colts, and they could only achieve NARROW victories over the Texans (most dreadful NFL roster) and the 49ers in Jimmy G's first start of the year.

But hey, the 2012 Broncos turned it around, winning out in the regular season, so the 2022 Broncos could too, right? Well, anything is possible, but the 2012 Broncos won out in part because in the next 11 games, they only face TWO playoff teams (Bengals and Ravens).

The 2022 Broncos next 12 games include six 2021 playoff teams (Titans, Raiders, Chiefs twice, Cardinals, Rams, who won the Super Bowl), plus the Ravens who missed the playoffs after a season with Lamar riddled with injuries. These two teams are NOT the same!

Then there's the other part of the narrative: ""Peyton himself struggled early just like Russell!"" OK. Let's look at that stats:

Peyton Manning in first 5 Broncos games: 66% completion, 1499 Yards, 11 TDS, 3 INTs, Avg Rating: 103.22.

Russell Wilson in first 5 Broncos games: 59% completion, 1254 Yards, 4 TDS, 3 INTs, Avg Rating: 84.68.

How is that comparable?? Manning was WAY better than Russell in his first 5 Broncos games, and it's not even close. 11-3 TD:INT ratio, as opposed to 4:3. 66% completion as opposed to 59%. Average passer rating nearly 20 points higher.

I'm not willing to give hot takes like ""Russ is washed"" or ""Seattle fleeced Denver in the trade."" I'm just not. Russ could turn it around (though I do think this is his worst 5-game stretch ever). But acting like this is just par for the course and everything's fine is just cope. The Broncos look bad, and they look MUCH worse than the 2012 Broncos over the same 5-game stretch. If the facts and data backed up the dominant narrative, even a little bit, I'd understand it, but they don't.",Comparing the first 5 Games of Russ with the Broncos and Manning with the Broncos

With the NFL season about 25% of the way complete, who do you guys think will make it out of the AFC and the NFC?

As far as the NFC goes, I am totally not buying the eagles start at all. Yes, they have the best record in the NFL and remain the lone undefeated team, but for some reason, I just don't trust their offense to keep it up. I think the NFC is a bit harder to predict also because there's just been a lot of weird early games so far, but curious to hear what y'all think!

nfl,,[Stapleton] Saquon Barkley is back on the Giants' sideline and warming up by having David Sills bump into his shoulder a few times. Barkley is back on the field.
nfl,,"[Clark] Real talk. The Giants are leaps and bounds better than they were last year bruh. If the Giants interview process was a sham it might be worth the lawsuit, because the only person who called the wrong Brian was Belichick. Without a doubt Daboll is the right BRIAN for this job."
nfl,,[S. W.] on Twitter - Jones bloody throwing hand as Barkley was in the locker room
nfl,,[Highlight] Barkley ends the defenders life with a juke.
nfl,Myself and a friend thought it would be fun to go watch some older games when people were allowed to target and stuff like that.,What is the hardest hitting game you remember?
nfl,,[Highlight] Giants take the lead!

nfl,,"[Yates] Geno Smith over the past two weeks: Week 3: 32-of-44, 325 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT Week 4: 23-of-30, 320 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT With 300+ yards today, he would become the first player in Seahawks history with 3 straight 300+ passing yard games."
nfl,"All I wanted to do today was watch the packers play in London against the giants but once again (just like every other week so far this season) the nfl app refuses to let me watch any of the games because of ‚Äúerror code 403 forbidden.  I‚Äôve tried scanning for malware, I‚Äôve tried dis-connecting from Wifi and using my hotspot, nothing works. Anyone else find a solution yet",Stupid NFL App error codes
nfl,I just got stationed in SC and haven‚Äôt really made friends yet so i decided to drive to charlotte to catch a panthers game. Just feel weird because i‚Äôm going alone for the first time and don‚Äôt know the area at all. Anyone do this often or in the past?,is it weird to go to a game alone?
nfl,,[Highlight] Giants hold strong and win.
nfl,,[Kimes]‚Ä¶.the 4-1 Giants?!
nfl,Who would‚Äôve thought? BIG BLUE!,The NYG are about to be 4-1. Surprised?
nfl,,Saquon Barkley with a SICK JUKE!
nfl,,[Highlight] Giants stop Packers on 4th down.
nfl,Just watching all the games this season and the last few how many different down to the wire crazy endings starting to think the game is rigged my dads probably right.,Starting to think the nfl is rigged it‚Äôs all a money scheme.

nfl,"Taysom playing QB, FB, HB, TE, WR, and kick returner are all impressive. However, there are a limited number of other players in NFL history that have be allowed to throw a TD pass in the same game that they rushed for/caught a touchdown.

What is absolutely insane is that Taysom also is put in on special teams and recovered a fumble. You know that it is risky to put a weapon that you are paying $10 mil/year for out there on defense and special teams, but if you watch he is making a huge impact and probably why they keep playing him in those roles. 

For the [fumble recovery](https://twitter.com/Saints/status/1579171617640529925), he is able to recover the fumble because he drives his man Josh Jones 11 yards into the backfield.

nfl,"There is a stark contrast to how general NFL fans view Dak versus Cowboys fans. If you go to any Cowboys discussion board, you will see that majority of Cowboys fans are done with Dak, including Dak's stans. I know some of the most die-hard Dak fans have finally admitted that they were wrong about Dak. Yet I keep seeing how general NFL fans constantly put Dak in the top 10 and I don't get it? 

I would put my money on the fact that Cowboys fans know more about Dak and the Cowboys than general NFL fans, and this is not throwing shade at anyone. But I question if people actually watch Cowboys game? Because if you have, you can see that Dak is a bottom 10 to bottom 5 QB in the league. Dak also played in the worst division in football in consecutive years (minus this year) and the Cowboys have constantly under-performed. Furthermore, Dak constantly stat pad even when the game is completely out of reach. If anyone watched the Broncos game last year, you would realize just how bad Dak really is, and that one of many bad games that Dak have had in his career. 

The only argument or saving grace for Dak is that he has never had a good coach in his career. But the problem for Dak just not an accurate thrower. You can't fit a square peg in a round hole. A better coach would tailor their offense around him and do more play-action, but he is still a very limited QB. There is a reason he was drafted in the fourth round, and while he has surpassed all expectation, he just not an elite QB, and at best just average. 

Why do people here think Dak is a top 10 QB? Do people think the Cowboys don't regret giving him that atrocious contract?",Why do folks think Dak is a good QB?

nfl,"Spotted this on the ESPN Throwback channel on YouTube. [From MLB.com](https://www.mlb.com/cut4/deion-sanders-flies-to-pittsburgh-for-1992-nlcs/c-153956568):

&gt; On Oct. 11, 1992, Deion Sanders returned two kicks and one punt for the Atlanta Falcons in a game against the Dolphins in Miami.

&gt; He hauled in one reception for nine yards and helped hold Dan Marino to 250 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. After the Dolphins won, 21-17, Prime Time hustled to catch a flight to Pittsburgh to meet up with the Braves for Game 5 of the NLCS.

&gt; Had he gotten in, Sanders would have been the first person to play in games in two major American professional sports leagues on the same day. Sadly, he was left out of the starting lineup and wasn't used as a substitute in the 7-1 Pirates victory.

From a [2017 Bleacher Report article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2738003-the-day-deion-did-both-25-years-ago-prime-time-suited-up-for-2-sports-in-1-day) interviewing Sanders about it where he shared his thoughts and even talked about a possible documentary about the day:

&gt; It clearly irks Sanders that he didn't get to step on the field at Three Rivers Stadium that night, as he admits much of his planned documentary will focus on who is responsible for his healthy scratch: ""You have to ask yourself, 'Why?' There had to be something behind that."" He won't say who because, master pitchman that he is, he's saving the reveal for his movie. ""I won't disclose what was behind it, but it wasn't on my behalf,"" he says, shooting down the question in the classiest way possible.

&gt; Speculation abounds that then-Braves manager Bobby Cox was upset at Sanders for his decision to play both games that day, but attempts to reach Cox or other former Braves were unsuccessful.

&gt; The standard critique directed at Sanders by pundits at the time was that he wasn't taking either game seriously enough to pick one, especially considering the Braves had a chance to clinch the National League pennant that night. To this day, Sanders is adamant that he took his responsibilities to both teams seriously: ""Both of them were important. Both games were important. It's a game. There's fans. There's teammates. There's family. Everything. Every time you compete, it's important.""","30 years ago today, Deion Sanders became the first player to suit up for an NFL game and MLB game on the same day (October 11, 1992)"

&gt;As you may have heard by now, Seattle is facing a potential problem next Sunday if the Mariners and Astros series reaches game 4. This due to their NFL team, the Seahawks, scheduled to host the Arizona Cardinals on 10/16. Each team shares a parking lot and this is the Seahawks only home game in a 4 week span. And unfortunately the Cardinals have another game scheduled on Thursday in Arizona so moving the NFL game to Monday is not possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moving the Mariners series to Fri/Sat as opposed to Sat/Sun is an option as well as moving the start time of either/both games.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, the NFL‚Äôs Atlanta Falcons, Los Angeles Rams, and Cleveland Browns also have home games scheduled for 10/16 in their respective cities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meaning if the Dodgers/Padres reaches game 5, LA will also be hosting 2 games (game scheduled for 10/16 if necessary)  
&gt;  
&gt;And if the Yankees/Guardians reaches game 4, Cleveland will be hosting 2 games (game scheduled for 10/16 if necessary)  
&gt;  
&gt;And lastly if the Braves/Phillies reaches game 5, Atlanta will be hosting 2 games (game scheduled for 10/16 if necessary)  
&gt;

A redditor asked if Huber had slept with my SO because I was so critical of his game on Sunday. a 46...yeesh, but fitting. Stout only had two punts, both mostly neutral and its another grade that is replacement level. he hasn't seen a grade over 61 since the Jets game in Week 1. I do not believe Dickson's mental error is factored into the grade in case anyone wondered. Logan Cooke is looking like an excellent punter for the 3rd year in a row. Overall, after a crazy 4 week start, punter grades fell back to earth a little for Week 5 (outside of Pin).","[PFF] Punting Grades for Week 5, the 2022 season, the last 4 weeks (2-5), and pEPA/expected"

Please see below for the ranking explanation:

This ranking assumes that there are never any fluke games and all teams are appropriately ranked. If you beat a team that is higher ranked than you, you move ahead of them and they move down one spot. However, other teams can jump in front of teams that are higher ranked than you, moving you further down the rankings.

The rankings were derived from the 2020 season opening NFL Title Belt holder as the only team ranked (Chiefs). The first team to beat them (Raiders-week 5) took first place and moved the Chiefs to second. In week 7, the Bucs beat the Raiders, moving both teams down.

With the Lions' first win of the 2021 season, all teams have beaten a team who has beaten a team who has beaten a team... who beat the Title Belt holding 2020 Chiefs in week 5. Please note that tracking the rankings back further back than 2020 will not make a difference because all rankings are eventually set by losses by the belt holders. Any team that is ranked higher than the Browns this year must have either beaten them or beaten a team that had already jumped them (has a path of beating teams that leads to the Browns). Bye weeks and ties do not affect a team's relative rankings. However, they can still shift down due to lower ranked teams jumping higher ranked teams.","NFL Title Rankings Week 5, 2022 Season"

nfl,"I went to the Bengals/Dolphins game last week. There were 9 kickoffs by my count. I believe that only 2 of them were returned. It became somewhat comical watching all the players line up on both sides just to watch the ball sail past the end zone and then trot back over to their sideline over and over. The kickoff system is clearly broken. 

I know that the league wanted to limit injuries on kickoffs, so they let teams get it at the 25 instead of the 20 for a touchback, and they moved the kicking spot closer so that it was easy to just kick it out of the end zone. I suppose mission accomplished since the ""kickoff"" has basically become a formality at this point. But is it really a ""fix"" to pretend like kickoffs are still a thing, when really they're only being returned a fraction of the time?

There are lots of good proposals out there to fix this. I personally like the idea of giving the scoring team the ball with 4th and 15 at their own 20 yard line. Most teams will punt (which the league should like since punts are safer than kickoffs because both teams are running in the same direction). But some teams can go for a big pass or a big run in order to keep the ball. This eliminates the need for kickoffs and the truly bizarre concept of an onside kick. 

I would also be in favor of keeping the traditional kickoff alive at the start of each half, but move the kicking spot back and require a kick to be returned. Then we all are guaranteed two kickoffs each game (which is about how many are happing with the current system anyways).

The receiver netted 171 yards and two scores on just three receptions Sunday, as the Bills cruised to a 38-3 blowout victory ‚Äîgiving flashbacks of his record-breaking playoff performance in last season‚Äôs heartbreaker in Kansas City. Speaking of, guess where the team heads next? Yes, just in time for Halloween, Buffalo has to revisit the scene of two playoff nightmares, this time looking to conquer old foes, and head into the bye week sitting on three straight wins. This may not be a playoff game, but rest assured it means a lot to this team and these fans; it might also have playoff implications down the line, as the Bills and Chiefs are still the teams to beat atop the AFC. This could very well shape up to be the game of the year so far.
2.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	-1	|	5-0	|	While the Eagles are 5-0 for the only the third time in franchise history (1981, 2004), the narrative this week focuses solely on one thing, and one thing only - Eagles vs Cowboys, Sunday Night Football.  The Eagles did just enough in Arizona to stay undefeated, it will take a more concerted effort against Dallas with tensions (and tempers) undoubtably at peak levels. 
3.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	--	|	4-1	|	It was not pretty but the Chiefs got the job done. Even considering a ludicrous roughing the passer call, the young Chiefs defense did not perform well against the Raiders. The Chiefs defensive line, especially, was bullied all game by a Raiders offensive line that seemed to be a weakness heading into the season. On offense the Chiefs enjoyed better success behind a hilariously awesome game by Travis Kelce that saw him only record 25 yards but score 4 times. It is fitting that Patrick Mahomes passed Troy Aikman on the all time passing touchdowns chart during a game Aikman was commentating. Next up, the biggest game of the year.
4.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	+1	|	3-2	|	Great game by the Ravens defense, holding Jamarr Chase to 50 yards on 7 receptions, preventing downfield plays, although allowing tons of rushing yards. Made the stops when it counted though. Humphrey and Peters were sticky on the Bengals receivers the entire game, JPP making his impact immediately with batted passes all over the field, constant pressure, and chasing wide receivers from behind. It's like we're in the 2011 playoffs. We ended up overcoming a pretty underwhelming passing game by Lamar. Kicking the field goal on 4th and inches was a good call to make since there was plenty of time left on the clock in case the Bengals scored a touchdown, given that the perfect time management on the final drive led to [another vintage Tucker moment.](https://v.redd.it/vvxtcr6xgws91) After all, getting past the 50 with Lamar Jackson is not difficult for this team. Ronnie Stanley looked great in his limited reps back and hopefully we will ramp him, Gus, and Dobbins up in the closing stretch for a playoff push. We finally got the home game losing streak off our back.

6.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	+1	|	3-2	|	After five weeks, it's hard to gauge just who the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are. Offensive injuries have been aplenty. Some weeks the defense has shown up and on other weeks it looks like it's still coached by Lovie Smith. But after a two game losing streak, the Bucs retook the division lead with a much-needed win over the Atlanta Falcons (who once blew a 25 point lead to Tom Brady in Super Bowl LI). Following the roughing the passer call at the end of the game, r/NFL joined hands together, sang *Heal the World* by Michael Jackson, unanimously celebrated the wonderful performances of the referee crew, and later would praise the referees for flagging Chris Jones on a Derek Carr strip sack to make up for all the times his brother was brutally murdered behind the Texans line. Next up, the Steelers in Pittsburgh where TJ Watt won't be around to be mean to others. #StopBullying
7.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	+1	|	4-1	|	Kirk Cousins started the game with a record-breaking 17-straight completions, Justin Jefferson posted another easy 150-yard game, and [Christian Darrisaw killed a guy](https://twitter.com/WillRagatz/status/1579164677182922752).  But despite being up 21-3 early, the Vikings allowed Justin Fields to claw his way back just enough so that Cousins could earn his third-straight fourth-quarter comeback and [Cam Dantzler could activate the Vikings' sleeper agent](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1579197990681694215). 
8.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	+2	|	3-2	|	The 49ers scored a pyrrhic victory on Sunday, defeating the Panthers 37-15 in Carolina. Emmanuel Moseley, who caught an interception for a TD in the game, suffered a season ending ACL injury. Jimmy Ward, in his first game this season, broke his hand in the opening kickoff. Nick Bosa suffered what is described as a groin injury, and he is day to day and will be reevaluated this week. With the injuries piling up, the defense's depth will be tested as the season continues in Atlanta on Sunday.
9.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	-5	|	3-2	|	It should be no surprise that a team founded by a member of the ""Fighting Irish"" in a city founded by a French explorer would really not like to play football in England. The defense couldn't force a stop when it counted and the offense could pick up the slack in the second half. Maybe the team thought they were playing soccer instead? Perhaps Joe Barry thought they were playing soccer and didn't want his corners pressing receivers for fear of drawing a red card? Maybe Rodgers and Lafleur thought running with the ball was illegal, so Aaron threw the ball twice as many times even though Aaron Jones was doing pretty darn well? Or maybe these ""fluke"" games is a trend that we're just a pretender. 
10.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	+2	|	3-2	|	4th down discourse once again headlined this game, but regardless of how one felt about that there was a lot to like from this game. The Chargers overcame an early 14-point deficit, finally got their running game going, and a questionable tackle duo once again kept Herbert clean, this time against arguably the best pass rush they'll face all season. The defense is a work in progress but it was good to see the offense build of the previous week.
11.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	+5	|	4-1	|	It was a fair criticism coming into sunday's game against GB that the Giants had only ever beaten ""bad"" teams. However, after what they were able to pull off in London, it may be time to start taking the Giants seriously. Let's have a look at exactly how decimated this roster was by injury: NY was missing its WR 1-4, both starting outside CBs and both their backups (the starting corners for the last drive were Nick McCloud and Justin Layne, both practice squad players). They were out their best defensive player in Leonard Williams, and their 1A pass rusher in Azeez Ojulari. Several OL also went down during the game and Saquon had to miss a drive. Oh yeah, that drive that Daniel Jones took the Giants 91 yards down the field almost single-handedly with a bloodied throwing hand, throwing lasers. To say Big Blue pitching a shutout in the 2nd half while putting up points on 5 straight drives despite the copious amount of injuries is nothing short of miraculous and speaks more volumes about the quality of this coaching staff than I or any other fan ever could. This team is fighting for Brian Daboll and co. and they are having a lot of fun doing it. Another test of the Giants' true quality comes this weekend against Baltimore.
12.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	-6	|	3-2	|	After a fun first three weeks of the season, we're finally back in our natural habitat of gloom, disappointment, and controversy. Week 4's hit against Tua Tagovailoa lead to major changes in how the league approaches potentially concussed players in the NFL, and almost fittingly our team was the first to suffer due to that change. After the very first play of our game against the Jets, our QB2 got ruled out of the game because an ataxia spotter claimed that Teddy Bridgewater stumbled at some point of the game. Not a single fan, media member, or anyone else has come forward with anything indicating that Teddy Bridgewater actually stumbled at any point prior to him entering concussion protocol. Our coach also reviewed the supposed evidence the spotter provided, and also claims he did not see Teddy stumble. Teddy ended up passing concussion protocol, but was unable to return back to the game and cannot practice with the team until Thursday. This lead to us being forced to play a 7th round rookie (who had zero NFL snaps and no reps with the starters) for essentially the entire game, and the results were predictable. But aside from yet another new controversy that screws us over, our 40-17 loss to a hated division rival, our defense once again getting exposed as fraudulent, multiple injuries to key players, and every AFC East team winning except for us, Sunday went pretty well for Dolphins fans.
13.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	-4	|	2-3	|	The Ravens remembered what Burrow and Chase did to them last year and shut the Bengals passing game down with a brilliant game strategy. Without Tee Higgins healthy the Bengals were exposed as a team with no depth for offensive weapons, and coach Zac Taylor does not have the offense running efficiently enough to make up for that. Sloppy and ill-timed play calls at big moments of the game doomed the Bengals and cost them what could have been a big road win. 
14.	| [](/LAR) | Rams | 	-3	|	2-3	|	Our O-line stinks and it‚Äôs not just the new Kolone. There‚Äôs going to be a lot of symptoms of this disease, like an absence of a run game, Stafford‚Äôs struggles, and the inability to get Allen Robinson involved. Until the front-line improves, matchups against strong defensive fronts are going to be a nightmare, even if on paper the Rams look better. Our defense is capable of keeping games a one score difference, but when the offense only puts up 1 TD in 2 games there‚Äôs only so much they can do. At least we have the Dodgers to distract us for now. #WinForVin
15.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	+4	|	3-2	|	The Titans were able to hold on and win against the Commanders by a last second David Long Jr. interception by Wentz. Derrick Henry found the end zone again for his 73rd TD, tying him with Earl Campbell in Titans franchise history, one behind Eddie George (74).
16.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	+7	|	2-3	|	I‚Äôm not counting any chickens, and I‚Äôm not making any assumptions. I‚Äôm just saying that if the 2022 Patriots exceed the 2021 Patriots in record, division placement, or playoff round achieved then I‚Äôm fully prepared to get ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a process.‚Äù tattooed on my left butt cheek.
17.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	-2	|	2-3	|	That‚Äôs a rough way to lose. Hug your kickers, folks. Aside from the possible [‚Äúwas it a first down or not‚Äù conspiracy](https://twitter.com/jimmykempski/status/1579249620353368064?s=46&amp;t=EcjxXc5HPvWcwWaw7nQ9VA), there was a lot of positives to take away from that game, and going toe to toe with the top team in the NFC should feel good even in a loss. The offense with Marquise Brown and Eno Benjamin seems to actually come alive. The defense has been playing really decent since halftime of the Raiders game. This team is trending upwards, and the negativity in the fanbase feels a little unwarranted at *this* point. We have lost to the great teams, and beat the teams we should have.
18.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	-2	|	2-3	|	The Charges flat out gave the Browns a gift with a blown first down and decent field position to kick a game winner.  That said, I knew it. You knew it. Every Browns fan knew it.  Once York got set we all said ""So he's gonna miss it and we're gonna lose"".  The Browns face the Pats at home next week.  Oh Joy.
19.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	+7	|	3-2	|	SAAAAAAAUUUUUCE!!!!! The rookie corner came up big on Sunday, forcing a safety in Miami's first offensive snap and getting his first career interception. Jets fans won't apologize for beating Miami's 3rd string QB after we had to endure Joe Flacco for three weeks. Perhaps Tua would have been playing if the organization handled his first concussion properly. But they didn‚Äôt, so he wasn‚Äôt. Instead, it was Skylar Thompson under center for Miami, and the Jets took advantage of the Dolphin‚Äôs seventh round rookie. Carl ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who knocks‚Äù Lawson ruined Skylar‚Äôs life with SEVEN QB hits and one strip sack that sealed the game. Oh yeah, and a glorious moment after Quinnen Williams recovered the aforementioned fumble where [he tossed Tyreek Hill back to Kansas City.]( https://twitter.com/uSTADIUM/status/1579197990644109313) Overall, It really does feel like the Jets have turned a corner. Next week a game against Green Bay coming off their disappointing London game.
20.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	-6	|	2-3	|	Turns out the Jaguars probably were who we thought they were; Few surprised. I'd like to take the rest of this blurb to draw attention to [the horrid officiating crew that allowed this to happen this week](https://twitter.com/CFBBluePrint/status/1579200275532824576). If the NFL wants the sport to have any sort of integrity, issues like this must not happen.
21.	| [](/NO) | Saints | 	+4	|	2-3	|	Fear the Mormon man from New Orleans. [Taysom Hill had a phenomenal game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM-GwurEMjg) to lift the Saints over the Seahawks, and Alvin Kamara also made a very strong contribution in his return. While both teams made this an entertaining game as the scoreboard kept ticking over, [Chris Olave's scary moment added some worry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiFPIwa57Q8). His health will be crucial for a team trying to find its footing in the second month of the season, which faces the Bengals, Cardinals, Raiders and Ravens in coming weeks who will all be hoping the defense which was exploited this weekend is the one they face.
22.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	+2	|	1-4	|	As a Raiders fan I have seen countless terrible, game ruining calls, 99/100 times going against us. On Monday, a bad call (textbook by the rules, but a bad rule) went our way when the Chiefs were called for roughing the passer when Carr was strip sacked. After that point the Chiefs fans were able to bully the refs into handing the game over to the Chiefs. We have all seen make up calls, but in the second half the refs went above and beyond to make sure their golden boy, Mahomes, was able to come back and keep viewers watching what was originally looking like a blowout for the team that wasn't given any chance coming into the game. 
23.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	-5	|	2-3	|	Hey there Broncos Country, how are things?Garrett Bolles: broken leg. Javonte Williams: nuclear knee explosion. Russell Wilson: terminal case of weirdo energy and a partially torn lat. We‚Äôre the most penalized team in the league, we've perfected the tactical fumble, and we're allergic to the endzone. ‚ÄúHoW ArE thINgS‚Äù somebody else and leave us alone for like, a minute. Oh what‚Äôs that? Another primetime game next week? Each day we wake to a fresh nightmare. Our 2-3 record is the equivalent of a can of axe body spray emptied over the unwashed crotch of our performance ‚Äì everybody knows we stink. Can‚Äôt you just let us rot outside the view of such a big audience? We can‚Äôt even keep fans in their seats for overtime! WalMart Country, Let‚Äôs Rollback to preseason when we still had hope.There are still some bright spots to be sure. PS2 is brilliant, the special teams play looks good, and the pass rush is solid. Oh wait, this just in! Randy Gregory: on IR with an undisclosed knee injury. Baron Browning and Josey Jewell: week-to-week with sprains. Ronald Darby: torn ACL. But the loss of Javonte Williams is the most crippling given the alternative in our backfield, MGIII, a running back whose heart off the field is almost as big as the red mark on my forehead from the force of my palm each time he takes a handoff.Maybe it was foolish to expect an exciting offense right away out of a rookie HC, a freshly transplanted QB, a brand new ownership group and a stable of young stars who didn't get reps together in the preseason. That said, the fanbase wasn't even able to keep its cool up to this point. You can expect the negativity to continue piling up, especially after handing Josh McDaniels his only win of the season and participating in one of the worst football games ever played, let alone played in primetime.What a week to take over as Broncos ranker. See you Monday.
24.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	-3	|	2-3	|	Six minutes left in the third quarter at Raymond James, Arthur Smith &amp; co. looked up to a 0-21 scoreboard. It seemed like a wake up call, at least for the defense, who would hold Tampa Bay to three consecutive 3 and outs. Atlanta's offense wasn't far behind, with their two longest drives of the game coming in the 4th quarter, scoring touchdowns on both to cut the defecit to 6 points. A team that doesn't die will not win every game. What that team will do, however, make winning harder for their opponent. Grady sacking Brady would not have ended the game, but the bigger story is this team is playing for 60 minutes for the first time in years.
25.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	-4	|	2-3	|	Geno. Gunslinger. Smith. While Seattle may have lost in New Orleans, Geno continues to look like a stud on the field. The way he maneuvers the pocket without bailing is incredibly refreshing to see from a Seahawks quarterback, AND he has been making elite throws. All of his touchdown passes were great, but [his second touchdown to Lockett was a thing of absolute beauty.](https://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1579196532791779329?s=20&amp;t=eHl05eEBu2eOkTwHBBb--Q) The ball is perfectly placed with a lot of Saints swarming Lockett. [The offense is firing on all cylinders](https://twitter.com/BFawkes22/status/1579500754624081921?s=20&amp;t=UMeQLmclQHqMQMIjNP0kQQ), with a line anchored by two rookie tackles, three different tight ends that could be involved each week, and perhaps the best WR duo in the league. The defense, however, is an absolute mess. They have fallen below the Lions in yards allowed per game, but there are a lot of things to like for the future. Tariq Woolen, a weekly installment in this blurb, intercepted a pass in his third straight game. He is tied for second in interceptions this season and has been a [dominant starting cornerback for Seattle as a 5th round rookie.](https://twitter.com/PFF_Seahawks/status/1579516919824388096?s=20&amp;t=koH5-idIfpFuI78rtQKB4g) Coby Bryant is getting better each week, and Al Woods has been a monster on the interior. But as a whole, this unit needs to improve badly.
26.	| [](/IND) | Colts | 	+1	|	2-2-1	|	Sometimes a game doesn't feel like a game. For instance, the Colts' TNF matchup against the Broncos felt like a nuclear bomb going off and destroying civilization. How many injuries were there? How many fans left as overtime began? There's nothing that can even be said at this point; everybody knows how terrible this Colts offense is. Matt Ryan threw two horrendous interceptions and held onto the ball way too much, which was particularly bad because the offensive line continued to play at their offensive level. The defense played really well, but, then again, it was against a Broncos team who might actually have a worse offense than us. At the end of the day, a win's a win; but with the way things are going, it doesn't look like it'll mean much at the end of the season.
27.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	-7	|	1-4	|	That was about as complete a catastrophe as we've seen lately. The league's former #1 scoring offense got a whopping fuckall on the day. Defensive backs went down like dominoes - though a big sigh of relief for Savion Smith, who seems to be okay following a scary neck injury. He's now in the concussion protocol, but for those who remember Mike Utley, man what a scary moment. Good news! Goff didn't throw a pick-six. Monkey's Paw! He coughed up the ball for a scoop-and-score instead, because of course that happened. **Bye Bye Bye**: Next week's bye went from ""fuck, why does it have to be so early?"" to ""holy shit, thank the gods we have a bye next week."" Injuries continue to plague the team, but with the extra rest, most of the players out should be able to come back in time to face the Cowboys in Week 7. Don't expect Jamo, though. It appears that he's being slowrolled, and may come back around Week 10 or later. Beyond getting the walking wounded up and running, there's a chance now for the coaching staff to look things over and figure out just what the *fuck* is going on, and hopefully right the ship for the remaining two-thirds of the season. **Defensive Woes**: Detroit finally forced a pair of punts in the 4th qtr, but here are the results of all defensive drives in the last two games: 6 TDs, 7/8 FGs, 2 Punts, 1 INT, 1 Kneeldown. What's kind of crazy is that the Lions' defense actually *did* improve Sunday, somewhat, only allowing 1 offensive TD. This was even after the Patriots continually got excellent field position due to the fact that Detroit went 0 for the day on 4th down, after starting the season 8/12 on 4th down.
28.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	+1	|	2-3	|	The Bears' defense chose the worst possible moment to give up their first second half touchdown. Late in the game, the Vikings put together 17 plays, 75 yards, and 5 third down conversions on their way to Fields &amp; the offense, who finally showed the signs of growth we‚Äôve been hoping for as they took it to the Vikings until the buzzer, and showed off an aggressive, no-quit mentality. Fields looked confident, decisive, and went 12-13 for 135 &amp; a TD while throwing some deep balls so pretty as autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place. But as much as we saw Fields‚Äô growth &amp; potential, the last play of the game showed off (yet again) just how much more talent he needs around him. Meanwhile, the NFL has opened an investigation into former Viking Ihmir Smith-Marsette who not only took a touchdown of the board by committing a ‚Äúpenalty,‚Äù but gave the Vikings back the ball at the end of the game. 
29.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	-1	|	1-4-0	|	The Bills absolutely outclassed the Steelers on Sunday. There really isn't much to say about the quality of Buffalo compared to Pittsburgh. They really didn't even play their best football and it was enough to obliterate the Steelers. This team needs to figure out a way to establish a ground game. They can't send in a rookie QB on his first start and not give him any decent run plays. Admittedly, the weaker spot on the Bills was their pass defense and running into their D-line wasn't optimal. That said, the playcalling is atrocious, as is the gameplanning. While the O-line isn't great at run blocking, there's far too much speed, size, and talent at the skill positions to do this poorly. This team is not good. They're not even okay.
30.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	+2	|	1-3-1	|	The threat of a winless season is now behind the Texans, so even if we manage to tank for the 1st overall pick we'll still have this at least. Rookies continue to give fans reasons for hope, as both Stingley and Pierce continue to live up to the hype. Mills continues to...Mill about. This squad isn't hopeless, but it's still sometimes agonizing to watch. All we can hope for is constant improvement, since that's really what rebuilding is all about. 
31.	| [](/WAS) | Commanders |	-1	|	1-4	|	It‚Äôs October 9th and the competitive portion of the season is over. New name? PHAT L. Debut the new shiny black alternates in Dallas? PHAT L. Debut the new shiny Burgundy jerseys at home against Tennessee? PHAT L. Carson Wentz and his ‚Äúrevenge tour‚Äù? PHAT L. Ron Rivera and staff? PHAT L. Dan Snyder still taking up space and breathing perfectly good air? PHATEST OF L‚ÄôS. The rebrand and subsequent rollout have been a disaster and the only thing that could have saved this organization any face was winning games. Welp. How many new rock bottoms can this franchise hit before it becomes completely nonviable? How many coaches need to diminish their professional standing in this town? How many washed up QB‚Äôs need to be put out to pasture here? How many fans are actually still left? How long do we have to see and hear opposing teams taking over FedEx Field? Who wants to be associated with this fucking clown-show? Oh‚Ä¶ the game and blurb for this week. Uh, guess what? Same shit as every week forever. This team is usually either pummeled or finds a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and today‚Äôs loss was one of those but I‚Äôm out of unique ways to describe losing. Until Dan Snyder sells the team not a goddamn thing will change and nobody should expect anything different. That‚Äôs the blurb.
32.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers | 	-1	|	1-4	|	I'm going to take a week off, this week, to not spell out FUCK WATSON or talk about how terrible the Panthers' coaching staff has been over the last couple of seasons.

nfl,"Hey guys, it's everyone's favorite annoying nerd back to talk about a bunch of junk that I think is cool.

I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/y0pu89/the_browns_rushing_offense_has_a_higher_total_epa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) yesterday talking about how the Browns, at this moment in the NFL calendar, have a truly, remarkably efficient rushing offense. So efficient in fact, that it has a higher EPA/play than all but the top five passing offenses. This is pretty wild, and it got me thinking.

If you've been paying attention, over the last two-ish years league average rushing yards per game has increased to levels that we haven't seen since at least the early 2000's, and really closer to the since the 80's. This year that has really reached a head, and journalists and analysts who are smarter than I have made note that [offense in general has been significantly less efficient this season](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2022/10/3/23385369/nfl-offensive-decline-superstar-quarterbacks-run-game), with many of the most efficient offenses being piloted by middle of the road QBs who are supported by strong run games (like Cleveland, Atlanta, Seattle and Detroit). I have heard multiple times that the gap between passing efficiency and rushing efficiency is narrowing in a strange and unforeseen way... but is that really true?

Well... yes. It absolutely it.

[The difference between league-averaged EPA\/play of rushing and passing vs. year.](https://preview.redd.it/l4lim9aqz7t91.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5266575b55ef9a4cc85e003edc5a75fd34d3f610)

**Obviously all of this criticism needs to be understood within the context that there have only been five weeks played thus far,** but regardless, is this not pretty damn interesting?

The disparity between EPA/play of rushing and passing this season is .0741, the lowest difference since 2003. Even if we discuss the 2021 season (.1309), our most recent full season, that was the lowest in nearly a decade (2013). Which is a pretty interesting thing when you look at the context of the league.

In 2013, the Seahawks won the Super Bowl in convincing fashion behind the dominance of the Seattle Cover 3, which went on to influence the entire league's defensive infrastructure for the next decade. This single-high safety defense was played by team's up until... well, 2020, when Vic Fangio disciple Brandon Staley reinvented the Rams defense and managed to be the best defense (and best run defense) in the league despite playing primarily two high coverages.

I won't belabor the point, I'm sure everyone is sick of hearing this by now. But two high defenses are everywhere. It's the new defensive meta, and it's gotten a lot of credit for slowing down Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen, and all of the other high-flying passing offenses that had been terrorizing the league over the several years prior to 2020. Mahomes flopped in the Super Bowl and notoriously struggled at the start of 2021, Allen and the Bills had a cold streak in the middle of 2021, and what did a lot of people say? They needed to switch things up, get stronger, get more physical and **run the ball** for once.

So it might come as no surprise that the Eagles, Giants, Falcons, Lions, Seahawks and Browns have all overperformed expectations on offense on the backs of their running games with QBs that most would have said were lacking before the season. Even Kansas City have shifted to a more run-heavy offense than we've seen in the Mahomes era, and lead the league in EPA/play. 

So it looks like the proliferation of this new style of defense has suddenly emphasized the running game and given it more value than it's had since the days of Priest Holmes and Emmitt Smith. Unless it hasn't. Look at this.

[Pearson Correlation Coefficient between rushing EPA\/play and total EPA\/play vs. year.](https://preview.redd.it/4gqgpvau28t91.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48cfdd14387c074291fb8da59c1b4f10820bc994)

Maybe this is just a bad metric for this, because the pattern is pretty scattered, but it should be interesting to note that this season's correlation coefficient is just .4409, the lowest correlation between rushing success per play and overall offensive success per play since EPA began getting tracked in 2000. Obviously the year prior that was quite different, as was the year prior, and the year before that. 

I also charted the correlation between rushing success rate and total EPA/play.

[Pearson Correlation Coefficient between rushing success rate and total EPA\/play vs. year.](https://preview.redd.it/nyk8qz5t38t91.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dafcd731101749d5abeeeb6c745521663f81dc4)

Maybe I would have been wiser to find the correlation between rushing EPA/play and total offensive EPA or something, but as you can see, whether it's EPA/play or success rate there isn't much of a pattern. Some years it indicates a very strong correlation, and some years is indicates only a moderate correlation.

This season, the Bills are the major outlier, second in total offensive EPA/play while in the bottom five in rushing EPA/play. But the Dolphins, Chargers, Raiders and Vikings also have top ten offenses with average or below average rushing EPA/play. And the Patriots are a middle of the road offense despite the second highest rushing EPA/play in the league. 

But, with that said, it does seem like more teams are having more success than usual being run-oriented teams. And while it doesn't seem like a prerequisite for success, it does seem like for the first time in a while run-oriented teams are no longer inherently more inefficient. It's a delicate interplay between rushing and passing, and a team's overall efficiency in one stat wouldn't look the same if not for the other. Odds are good that if Buffalo had a better running game, their passing game might be EVEN MORE efficient (a truly terrifying proposition). But I suppose the question of whether or not that would raise their overall offensive efficiency remains.

But that's all I got, let me know what you think.

TL;DR: Passing offense and rushing offense efficiency is as close as it's been since the early 2000's, but that doesn't seem to necessitate that a team have a high-quality running game in order to be a good overall offense. Though run-oriented teams are in a better place than ever.

Justin Herbert was the backup for his first game, started his 2nd game, and never gave up the starting job. This was convenient for keeping his stat comparisons even with other QBs through their first 2 seasons, as he finished year 2 at 32 starts despite completing a 17 game season. 

This season though, Justin Herbert is on pace for a record-shattering 49 games started at QB through his first 3 seasons, breaking a 8 way tie at 48 starts. 

Every other QB drafted 2020 or earlier has missed as many or more games in their career than the two 17th games from last year and this year can make up for.

Trevor Lawrence and Mac Jones are currently the only QBs averaging more than 16 starts a year, both starting 17 games in their 2021 rookie seasons. Mac Jones has now missed 2 games this season, and would finish the year at 32 career starts if he resumes playing this week. In this case, Jones would be able to rejoin the &gt;16 average starts club once again next season. 

Assuming every QB starts every game from this week on, here‚Äôs some QBs from the 16 game era who are likely to join the club soon:  

Derek Carr in 2023  
Kyler Murray, Matt Ryan, and Russell Wilson in 2024  
Josh Allen in 2026  
Baker Mayfield in 2027

nfl,,[Anderson] A league source told me on that same call that there‚Äôs some discussion/concern about QB Tua Tagovailoa potentially still needing more time out beyond Week 6 to be fully healed
nfl,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/y22gvi/absolute\_truck\_of\_a\_man/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/y22gvi/absolute_truck_of_a_man/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

The league really needs to look at the international sports and find the hidden gems. This UNIT would absolutely destroy defenses.",Next level running game
nfl,"While the Raiders defense has struggled Maxx Crosby has exploded over the first 5 games. Let's compare some of the other Defensive Players.

 

|Player|Tackles|TFL|Sacks|QBHits|FF|INT|PD|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Maxx Crosby|31|11|6|9|1|0|1|
|Micah Parsons|19|7|6|12|1|0|1|
|Matt Judon|19|4|6|11|1|0|1|
|Nick Bosa|15|6|6|16|0|0|0|
|Bradley Chubb|17|4|5.5|8|2|0|1|
|Aaron Donald|21|6|4|6|1|0|1|
|Derwin James|45|6|4|2|0|0|3|
|Devin Lloyd|49|0|0|0|0|2|6|
|Myles Garrett|9|4|3|5|1|0|1|

Now team record or team defense could be a factor in the voting, Khalil Mack won DPOY with the 20th ranked defense in 2016(albeit the team record was 12-4). PFF currently has Crosby ranked as the 2nd best defender with a  90.6 grade, including an impressive 79.9 against the run. Myles Garret is ranked 1st with a 91.5 and Micah Parsons is 3rd with a 90.5. 

The biggest knock on Crosby has always been he's one dimensional and was not a good run defender. He has shown incredible improvement in that area, specifically looking at his TFL's and the fact he has 4 more than the next person. Crosby probably won't have the media hype, that will go to Micah Parsons and Nick Bosa, but he deserves to be in the conversation and possibly be the frontrunner at this point.",Maxx Crosby for DPOY?
nfl,,"[Baby] Bengals QB Joe Burrow: ""We're going to go down there and fight our balls off for a W."""
nfl,"AFC

X (N), Siriani (E), Smith (S), Shannahan (W).","Every division has exactly one HC who's last name starts with the letter 'S', except for the NFC North. I'm not sure what it means yet, but I will get to the bottom of it."
nfl,[removed],Are college quarterbacks getting better each draft year?
nfl,,"[Demovsky] Know where you are. Know where the players are. Don‚Äôt run in front of the tunnel when you know players are leaving the field. We‚Äôre in their arena. All this is going to do is further restrict media access on the field, which then prevents us from taking fans where they can‚Äôt go."
nfl,"Friendly reminder that in 2020 the Rams had the number one scoring defense, a top 10 run game, a top 10 offensive line, Cooper Kupp, Robert Woods, Van Jefferson, and Tyler Higbee, and Goff still put up average numbers. There were a handful of games where Goff was clearly the biggest thing that was holding back the team like against the Dolphins, 49ers, and Seahawks week 15. 

I probably come off as a Goff hater but I‚Äôm not, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad QB. But just because he‚Äôs played well so far this season and the Rams have struggled doesn‚Äôt mean we get to do some revisionist history about his time in LA.",Jared Goff was the problem with the Rams.
nfl,,"[Yates] NFL schedule note: in the event that the Astros-Mariners series goes to a 4th game this Sunday, Seahawks-Cardinals will be moved back from 4:05 PM ET to 5:30 PM ET."

A friend that's an Eagles fan brought this up, and asked if I knew the record for the most consecutive POTW awards by a team, and I couldn't find anything online. I figured asking here might find the answer as it's an odd stat that a fan of the team who holds the record might randomly know, lol.   


Best I could find was a career leaders list, and we had fun talking about that, so I figure I'll shared that for anyone interested. [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/potw\_career.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/potw_career.htm)",What is the team record for consecutive Player Of The Week Awards?
nfl,"To start, yes devante could have hurt the guy, and it‚Äôs not okay.

He very well could hurt the streaker, Wagner went out of his way to do it, it‚Äôs not like security wouldn‚Äôt have taken care of it in a few moments like they do in every other instance?",How is Devante adams shoving the camera man worse then players tackling streakers?
nfl,,"[Yates] So, if the Mariners and Astros go to a Game 4, we would then have NFL games on continuously from 1 PM ET-11:30 PM ET. 10.5 hours of football in a row."

**The One Where Justin Fields is not that Good**

\- Justin Fields is last in terms of aggressive throws (defenders within a yard of the receiver) at 4.5%  yet somehow has the second-worst completion % over expectation (-10.4%) only better than Baker Mayfield who by these metrics, has been almost 4x as aggressive with his throws. 

\- Fields is second to Famous Jameis in average depth of target on play-action passes but is the worst in the NFL in adjusted completion percentage (drops + completions / on-target throws). This one might be more scheme/coaching based as Chicago seems to go for a lot of shot plays but those don't seem to be helping Fields much and he can't/won't make the hard throws. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sack-e Bombs**

\- Per PFF's QB Pressure stats, Carson Wentz (the most sacked and pressured QB of the year so far) has only caused himself to be under pressure 8.4% of the time, good for the 11th-lowest percentage in the league.

\- Conversely, Lamar Jackson has been credited with causing 30.6% of his own pressured snaps which is  6% higher than second-place Jacoby Brissett and would be the highest QB-owned pressure percentage since at least 2004. 

\-Justin Herbert has been pressured the most times (56) when NOT blitzed but, those pressures have turned into sacks just 8.6% of the time which is the second-fewest among Qbs who have played all 5 games. Jacoby Brissett is #1 with only 6.9% of non-blitz pressures becoming sacks but he has been under pressure exactly half as often as Herbert.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun Facts**

Geno Smith is leading the NFL in these categories:

\- PFF Passing Grade (87.9)

\- PFF Big Time Throws Percentage (6.4%0

\- Adjusted completion percentage (80.7)

\- Completion Percentage over expected ( + 9% almost four times better than second place Jalen Hurts at 2.7%)

Washington @ Chicago

Current Records: Washington 1-4; Chicago 2-3

What to Know

The Washington Commanders will take on the Chicago Bears at 8:15 p.m. ET Thursday at Soldier Field. Given that both teams suffered a loss in their last game, they both have a little extra motivation heading into this matchup.

The Commanders were within striking distance but couldn't close the gap this past Sunday as they fell 21-17 to the Tennessee Titans. A silver lining for Washington was the play of WR¬†Dyami Brown, who caught two passes for two TDs and 105 yards. Near the top of the highlight reel was Carson Wentz's 75-yard TD bomb to Brown in the second quarter.

Their defensive unit accumulated five sacks for a loss of 45 yards. Leading the way was DE¬†Montez Sweat¬†and his two sacks. Those were the first sacks for Sweat through five games.

Chicago came within a touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings this past Sunday, but they wound up with a 29-22 loss. Chicago's loss came about despite a quality game from QB¬†Justin Fields, who passed for one TD and 208 yards on 21 attempts in addition to picking up 47 yards on the ground.
Watch Bears vs. Commanders: TV channel, live stream info, start time


Special teams collected ten points for the Bears. K¬†Cairo Santos¬†delivered a perfect 3-for-3 game.

This next game is expected to be close, with the Commanders going off at just a 1-point favorite. Now might not be the best time to take Washington against the spread since they've let down bettors for the past four consecutive games.

Washington is now 1-4 while Chicago sits at 2-3. Washington is 0-3 after losses this season, the Bears 1-1.

In fact, no defensive players got a single MVP vote in one of the most defensive superbowls of all time.

nfl,"With the NFL likely to add a 19th week to the season, I'd like to propose the following series of changes, which would hopefully address concerns for player safety, and prevent ""unworthy"" teams from hosting a playoff game.

* Go to the already proposed 19 week schedule, but stay at 17 games per team with 2 bye weeks each. Less chance for injury, and more time to recuperate. Bye weeks could be scheduled for most teams prior to an appearance on Thursday night football.
* Add 4 new expansion teams: Oakland, San Diego, St. Louis, and Portland. This likely won't happen since there will be fewer viable places owners can threaten to move. Please feel free to suggest alternate cities you believe would be a better fit. Or make an argument about talent dilution.
* Return to 3 divisions per conference (East, West, Central) with six teams per division. Yes that means 10 division games per team, which some won't like, but it also limits the likelihood of a 7-10 (or worse) team hosting a game in the playoffs.

[Proposed Realignment](https://preview.redd.it/d5kd7oukjtt91.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5934e50111810ff3c76f52d508f839cb124cd931)

nfl,,Is Fields The Problem? | Week 6 Film Analysis | Tim Jenkins
nfl,"Tom Brady was just fined $11,139 for kicking Falcons DL Jarret Grady and people are asking how the NFL came up with such an arbitrary-looking number. 

The easy answer is that they are all laid out here:

[ACCOUNTABILITY: FINES &amp; APPEALS
The NFL/NFLPA's schedule of infractions and fines, and a process for appeal.](https://operations.nfl.com/inside-football-ops/rules-enforcement/accountability-fines-appeals/)

Striking/kicking/kneeing is $11,139 for a first offence and $16,444 for a second offence.

But how did we get to $11,139? For that answer, we need to go to the [2020 CBA, Page 397.](https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/NFLPA/CBA2020/NFL-NFLPA_CBA_March_5_2020.pdf) 

####Appenix U - 2020 Schedule of On-Field Fines

The important part is:

Violation| First Offense | Second Offense 
---|----|----
Striking/Kicking/Kneeing|  $10,500|  $15,500

That's the baseline for the 2020 season and agreed to by the league and the NFLPA.

To find out we got from there to here we again look at Page 277:

ARTICLE 46 - COMMISSIONER DISCIPLINE 

#####Section 1. League Discipline (d)

&gt; The 2020 Schedule of Fines and Aggravating/Mitigating Factors, which have been provided to and
accepted by the NFLPA and are attached hereto as Appendix U, shall serve as the basis
of discipline for the infractions identified on that schedule. ***The designated minimum fine
amounts will increase by 3% for the 2021 League Year, and each League Year thereafter
during the term of this Agreement.***

10,500 * 3% per year, for 2 years results in *11,139*. (10,500 * 1.03 = 10,815 * 1.03 = 11,139.45).

So, at first blush, 11,139 *appears* to be random but it's actually just a 3% annual increase from a more standard looking $10,500. Next year this fine will be $11,473. in 2024 it will be $11,817.

[Interestingly, according to this post from 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5dsnqk/9115_18231_24309_this_is_how_the_nfl_comes_up/) the annual increase used to be 5%.
